Acetaminophen Level : 1What is an acetaminophen level test? This test measures the amount of acetaminophen in the blood. Acetaminophen is one of the most common medicines used in over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers. It is found in more than 200 brand name medicines. These include Tylenol, Excedrin, Nyquil, and Paracetamol, which is commonly found outside the U. S. Acetaminophen is safe and effective when taken at the proper dose. But an overdose can cause serious and sometimes deadly liver damage. Unfortunately, dosing mistakes are common. Reasons for this include: Taking more than one medicine that contains acetaminophen. Many cold, flu, and allergy medicines contain acetaminophen. If you take more than one medicine with acetaminophen, you may end up taking an unsafe dose without realizing it Not following dose recommendations. The adult maximum dose is generally 4000 mgs in 24 hours. But that may be too much for some people. So it may be safer to limit your dose to 3000 mgs per day. Children's dosing recommendations depend on their weight and age. Giving a child an adult version of the medicine, rather than a version designed for children If you think you or your child has taken too much acetaminophen, call your health care provider right away. You may need to be tested and treated in the emergency room. Other names: acetaminophen drug test, acetaminophen blood test, Paracetamol test, Tylenol drug test1What is it used for? The test is used to find out if you or your child has taken too much acetaminophen.1Why do I need an acetaminophen level test? Your provider may order a test if you or your child has symptoms of an overdose. Symptoms may happen as soon as two to three hours after taking the medicine but can take as long as 12 hours to appear. Symptoms in adults and children are similar and may include: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Fatigue Irritability Sweating Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow1What happens during an acetaminophen level test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an acetaminophen level test.1Are there any risks to an acetaminophen level test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If results show a high level of acetaminophen, you or your child may be at risk for liver damage and may need immediate treatment. The type of treatment will depend on how much excess acetaminophen is in your system. After you get your results, your provider may repeat this test every four to six hours to make sure you are out of danger. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an acetaminophen level test? Before you or your child take any medicine, read the label carefully. Make sure that you only use the recommended dose. Check the ingredient list to see whether the medicines contain acetaminophen, so that you don't take too much. Common medicines that contain acetaminophen include: Nyquil Dayquil Dristan Contact Theraflu Actifed Mucinex Sudafed Also, if you drink three or more alcoholic beverages a day, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take acetaminophen. Drinking alcohol while taking acetaminophen can increase your risk of liver damage.1References CHOC Children's [Internet]. Orange (CA): CHOC Children's; c2020.

Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) is a type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis and certain other infections. Tuberculosis, commonly known as TB, is a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs. It can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain, spine, and kidneys. TB is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. TB can be latent or active. If you have latent TB, you'll have TB bacteria in your body but won't feel sick and can't spread the disease to others. If you have active TB, you'll have symptoms of the disease and could spread the infection to others. AFB tests are usually ordered for people with symptoms of active TB. The tests look for the presence of AFB bacteria in your sputum. Sputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva. There are two main types of AFB tests: AFB smear. In this test, your sample is "smeared" on a glass slide and looked at under a microscope. It can provide results in 1–2 days. These results can show a possible or likely infection, but can't provide a definite diagnosis. AFB culture. In this test, your sample is taken to a lab and put in a special environment to encourage the growth of bacteria. An AFB culture can positively confirm a diagnosis of TB or other infection. But it takes 6–8 weeks to grow enough bacteria to detect an infection. Other names: AFB smear and culture, TB culture and sensitivity, mycobacteria smear and culture1What are they used for? AFB tests are most often used to diagnose an active tuberculosis (TB) infection. They may also be used to help diagnose other types of AFB infections. These include: Leprosy, a once feared, but now a rare and easily treatable disease that affects the nerves, eyes, and skin. Skin often becomes red and flaky, with loss of feeling. An infection similar to TB that mostly affects people with HIV/AIDS and others with weakened immune systems. AFB tests may also be used for people who have already been diagnosed with TB. The tests can show if the treatment is working, and whether the infection can still be spread to others.1Why do I need an AFB test?  You may need an AFB test if you have symptoms of active TB. These include: Cough that lasts for three weeks or more Coughing up blood and/or sputum Chest pain Fever Fatigue Night sweats Unexplained weight loss  Active TB can cause symptoms in other parts of the body besides the lungs. Symptoms vary depending on which part of the body is affected. So you may need testing if you have: Back pain Blood in your urine Headache Joint pain Weakness You may also need testing if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk of getting TB if you: Have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with TB Have HIV or another disease that weakens your immune system Live or work in a place with a high rate of TB infection. These include homeless shelters, nursing homes, and prisons.1What happens during AFB testing? Your health care provider will need a sample of your sputum for both an AFB smear and an AFB culture. The two tests are usually done at the same time. To get sputum samples: You will be asked to cough deeply and spit into a sterile container. You will need to do this for two or three days in a row. This helps make sure your sample has enough bacteria for testing. If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a sterile saline (salt) mist that can help you cough more deeply. If you still can't cough up enough sputum, your provider may perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, you will first get medicine so you won't feel any pain. Then, a thin, lighted tube will be put through your mouth or nose and into your airways. The sample may be collected by suction or with a small brush.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for an AFB smear or culture.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to providing a sputum sample by coughing into a container. If you have a bronchoscopy, your throat may feel sore after the procedure. There is also a small risk of infection and bleeding at the site where the sample is taken.1What do the results mean? If your results on an AFB smear or culture were negative, you probably don't have active TB. But it could also mean there weren't enough bacteria in the sample for your health care provider to make a diagnosis. If your AFB smear was positive, it means you probably have TB or other infection, but an AFB culture is needed confirm the diagnosis. Culture results can take several weeks, so your provider may decide to treat your infection in the meantime. If your AFB culture was positive, it means you have active TB or another type of AFB infection. The culture can identify which type of infection you have. Once you have been diagnosed, your provider may order a "susceptibility test" on your sample. A susceptibility test is used to help determine which antibiotic will provide the most effective treatment. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about AFB testing? If not treated, TB can be deadly. But most cases of TB can be cured if you take antibiotics as directed by your health care provider. Treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections. After a few weeks on antibiotics, you will no longer be contagious, but you will still have TB. To cure TB, you need to take antibiotics for six to nine months. The length of time depends on your overall health, age, and other factors. It's important to take the antibiotics for as long as your provider tells you, even if you feel better. Stopping early can cause the infection to come back.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

ADHD screening, also called an ADHD test, helps find out if you or your child has ADHD. ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It used to be called ADD (attention-deficit disorder). ADHD is a behavioral disorder that makes it hard for someone to sit still, pay attention, and focus on tasks. People with ADHD may also be easily distracted and/or act without thinking. ADHD affects millions of children and often lasts into adulthood. Until their own children are diagnosed, many adults don't realize symptoms they've had since childhood may be related to ADHD. There are three main types of ADHD: Mostly Impulsive-Hyperactive. People with this type of ADHD usually have symptoms of both impulsivity and hyperactivity. Impulsivity means acting without thinking about the consequences. It also means a desire for immediate rewards. Hyperactivity means difficulty sitting still. A hyperactive person fidgets and moves about constantly. It can also mean the person talks nonstop. Mostly Inattentive. People with this type of ADHD have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted. Combined. This is the most common type of ADHD. Symptoms include a combination of impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattentiveness. ADHD is more common in boys than girls. Boys with ADHD are also more likely to have impulsive-hyperactive or the combined type of ADHD, rather than inattentive ADHD. While there is no cure for ADHD, treatments can help reduce symptoms and improve daily functioning. ADHD treatment often includes medicine, lifestyle changes, and/or behavioral therapy. Other names: ADHD test1What is it used for? ADHD screening is used to diagnose ADHD. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.1Why do I need ADHD screening? Your health care provider may order an ADHD test if you or your child has symptoms of the disorder. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe, and can vary depending on the type of ADHD disorder. Symptoms of impulsivity include: Nonstop talking Having trouble waiting for a turn in games or activities Interrupting others in conversations or games Taking unnecessary risks Symptoms of hyperactivity include: Frequent fidgeting with hands Squirming when seated Trouble staying seated for long periods of time An urge to keep in constant motion Difficulty doing quiet activities Trouble completing tasks Forgetfulness Symptoms of inattention include: Short attention span Trouble listening to others Being easily distracted Trouble staying focused on tasks Poor organizational skills Trouble attending to details Forgetfulness Avoidance of tasks that require a lot of mental effort, such as schoolwork, or for adults, working on complicated reports and forms. Adults with ADHD may have additional symptoms, including mood swings and difficulty maintaining relationships. Having one or more of these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you or your child has ADHD. Everybody gets restless and distracted at times. Most children are naturally full of energy and often have trouble sitting still. This is not the same as ADHD. ADHD is a long-lasting condition that can affect many aspects of your life. Symptoms may cause problems in school or work, home life, and relationships. In children, ADHD can delay normal development.1What happens during an ADHD screening? There is no specific ADHD test. Screening usually involves several steps, including: A physical exam to find out if a different type of disorder is causing symptoms. An interview. You or your child will be asked about behavior and activity level. The following tests are designed specifically for children: Interviews or questionnaires with people who interact regularly with your child. These may include family members, teachers, coaches, and babysitters. Behavioral tests. These are written tests designed to measure a child's behavior compared with the behavior of other children the same age. Psychological tests. These tests measure thinking and intelligence.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for ADHD screening? You usually don't need any special preparations for ADHD screening.1Are there any risks to screening? There is no risk to a physical exam, written test, or questionnaire.1What do the results mean? If results show ADHD, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible. Treatment usually includes a combination of medicine, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes. It can take time to determine the right dose of ADHD medicine, especially in children. Some non-drug therapies for children with ADHD have recently become available. They are only available by prescription and include: A small external device with a skin patch that is attached to a child's forehead. While the child is sleeping, the device delivers a mild electrical pulse that sends signals to the part of the brain thought to be involved in ADHD. It should only be used on children ages 7-12. A game-based device designed to improve attention and other ADHD symptoms. This device is designed to be used as part of a therapeutic program, which may include medicine, educational programs, and other treatments.  These therapies are still very new, and more studies are needed to figure out how effective they are. To learn more, talk to you child's health care provider. Your provider can also answer any other questions you have about results and ADHD treatments.1Is there anything else I need to know about ADHD screening? You or your child may get an ADHD test if you have a family history of the disorder, along with symptoms. ADHD tends to run in families. Many parents of children with ADHD had symptoms of the disorder when they were younger. Also, ADHD is often found in siblings of the same family.1References ADDA: Attention Deficit Disorder Association [Internet]. Attention Deficit Disorder Association; c2015–2018.

This test measures the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the blood. ACTH is a hormone made by the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain. ACTH controls the production of another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is made by the adrenal glands, two small glands located above the kidneys. Cortisol plays an important role in helping you to: Respond to stress Fight infection Regulate blood sugar Maintain blood pressure Regulate metabolism, the process of how your body uses food and energy Too much or too little cortisol can cause serious health problems. Other names: Adrenocorticotropic hormone blood test, corticotropin1What is it used for? An ACTH test is often done along with a cortisol test to diagnose disorders of the pituitary or adrenal glands. These include: Cushing's syndrome, a disorder in which the adrenal gland makes too much cortisol. It may be caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland or the use of steroid medicines. Steroids are used to treat inflammation, but can have side effects that effect cortisol levels. Cushing's disease, a form of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's disease is usually caused by a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor makes too much ACTH. This causes the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. Addison disease, a condition in which the adrenal gland doesn't make enough cortisol. Hypopituitarism, a disorder in which the pituitary gland does not make enough of some or all of its hormones.1Why do I need an ACTH test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of too much or too little cortisol. Symptoms of too much cortisol include: Weight gain Buildup of fat in the shoulders Pink or purple stretch marks (lines) on the abdomen, thighs, and/or breasts Skin that bruises easily Increased body hair Muscle weakness Fatigue Acne Symptoms of too little cortisol include: Weight loss Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal pain Dizziness Darkening of the skin Salt craving Fatigue You may also need this test if you have symptoms of hypopituitarism. Symptoms will vary depending on the severity of the disease, but may include the following: Loss of appetite Irregular menstrual periods and infertility in women Loss of body and facial hair in men Lower sex drive in men and women Sensitivity to cold Urinating more often than usual Fatigue1What happens during an ACTH test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) overnight before testing. Tests are usually done early in the morning because cortisol levels change throughout the day.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Results of an ACTH test are often compared with the results of cortisol tests and may show one of the following: High ACTH and high cortisol levels: This may mean Cushing's disease. Low ACTH and high cortisol levels: This may mean Cushing's syndrome or a tumor of the adrenal gland. High ACTH and low cortisol levels: This may mean Addison disease. Low ACTH and low cortisol levels. This may mean hypopituitarism. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an ACTH test? A test called an ACTH stimulation test is sometimes done instead of an ACTH test to diagnose Addison disease and hypopituitarism. An ACTH stimulation test is a blood test that measures cortisol levels before and after you've received an injection of ACTH.1References Family doctor.org [Internet].

An albumin blood test measures the amount of albumin in your blood. Low albumin levels can be a sign of liver or kidney disease or another medical condition. High levels may be a sign of dehydration. Albumin is a protein made by your liver. Albumin enters your bloodstream and helps keep fluid from leaking out of your blood vessels into other tissues. It is also carries hormones, vitamins, and enzymes throughout your body. Without enough albumin, fluid can leak out of your blood and build up in your lungs, abdomen (belly), or other parts of your body. Other names: ALB, serum albumin test1What is it used for? An albumin blood test is used to check your general health and to see how well your liver and kidneys are working. If your liver is damaged or you're not well nourished, your liver may not make enough albumin. If your kidneys are damaged, they may let too much albumin leave your body in urine (pee). An albumin blood test is often done as part of a group of blood tests that measure different enzymes, proteins, and other substances made in your liver. These tests are called liver function tests or liver panel.  An albumin test may also be part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), a group of routine blood tests that measures several substances.1Why do I need an albumin blood test? Your health care provider may order an albumin test as part your regular checkup. The test may be ordered as part of a group of liver function tests or a comprehensive metabolic panel. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of liver or kidney disease. Symptoms of liver disease include: Nausea and vomiting Lack of appetite Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly) Swelling in your ankles and legs Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop) Frequent itching Symptoms of kidney disease include:  Swelling in the hands and feet or puffy eyelids Dry skin, itching, or numbness Fatigue Increased or decreased urination Urine that is bloody or foamy Loss of appetite and weight loss Muscle cramps Nausea and vomiting Shortness of breath Sleep problems Trouble thinking clearly With some types of kidney disease, such as chronic kidney disease, you may not have symptoms until the later stages.1What happens during an albumin blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations to test for albumin in blood. If your provider ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow. Certain medicines may affect your test results, so tell your provider what you are taking. But don't stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider first.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? An albumin blood test alone cannot diagnose a condition. Your provider will usually consider your albumin test results with the results of other tests to make a diagnosis. Lower than normal albumin levels may be a sign of: Liver disease, including severe cirrhosis, hepatitis, and fatty liver disease Kidney disease Malnutrition Infection Digestive diseases that involve problems using protein from food, such as Crohn's disease and malabsorption disorders Burns over a large area of your body Thyroid disease Higher than normal albumin levels may be a sign of dehydration, which may be caused by severe diarrhea or other conditions. If your albumin levels are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines, including steroids, insulin, and hormones, can increase albumin levels. Not eating can cause a large decrease in albumin after 24 to 48 hours. Other medicines, including birth control pills, can lower your albumin levels. Albumin levels are lower during pregnancy. Your provider can explain what your test results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References American Liver Foundation [Internet]. New York: American Liver Foundation; c2021.

Alcohol use screening tests are questionnaires designed to find out if you have alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD is a pattern of excessive drinking that can cause serious problems in your work, relationships, and health. AUD can be mild, moderate, or severe. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcohol abuse or alcoholism. Most people who drink alcohol don't have AUD. But if you have AUD, you may: Find it hard to control the amount of alcohol you drink Spend a lot of time thinking about drinking Need increasing amounts of alcohol to feel its effects AUD is a disease that can be treated. If you have AUD, an alcohol use screening test can help your provider make an effective treatment plan for you. Other names: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), AUDIT-C, Cut down Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE) tool, Tolerance, Annoyed Cut down, Eye-opener (T-ACE) tool, Screening with Brief Intervention (SBI) Tool1What are they used for? Alcohol use screening tests are used to diagnose AUD. Some tests can also help show if the disease is mild, moderate, or severe.1Why do I need an alcohol use screening test? You may need a screening test if you have symptoms of alcohol use disorder (AUD). These include: Drinking more or longer than you planned Trying to cut down or quit but being unable to do it Hiding liquor bottles and glasses so others don't see evidence of drinking Strong craving for alcohol Continuing to drink even if it causes problems in your personal relationships, work, school, and/or health Building up a tolerance to alcohol. That means you need more and more alcohol to feel its effects. Some people with AUD don't know or want to admit they have a problem. If your family, friends, or co-workers express concerns about your drinking, talk to your health care provider about getting a screening. Your provider may also recommend a screening if they notice signs and symptoms of the disorder.1What happens during an alcohol use screening test? Alcohol use screening may be done by your primary care provider or a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. Some mental health providers specialize in treating AUD and similar disorders. There are different types of alcohol use screening tests. But they each include questions about your drinking habits and how they affect your life. The most commonly used alcohol screening tests are: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). This test contains 10 multiple choice questions about how much and how often you drink alcohol and if you have any alcohol-related problems or reactions. The answers are scored on a point system. A score of 8 or more may indicate AUD. AUDIT-C is a shortened version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). It contains three multiple choice questions. Each answer is valued from 0 to 4 points. The higher the score, the more likely it is you have AUD. Cut down Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE).  This contains the following yes or no questions:

Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?
Eye-opener: have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves?

 Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking? Eye-opener: have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves? Two or more "yes" answers may indicate AUD. Tolerance, Annoyed Cut down, Eye-opener T-ACE.  This test is similar to CAGE and is targeted toward pregnant women. It contains the following yes or no questions:

Tolerance: How many drinks does it take to make you feel high?
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
Eye-opener: have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves?

 Tolerance: How many drinks does it take to make you feel high? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking? Eye-opener: have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves? Two or more "yes" answers indicate a possible AUD. Screening with Brief Intervention (SBI) Tools. These tests contain a series of yes or no questions targeted to developing brief interventions. Brief interventions are short-term counseling sessions and treatment strategies designed to help people make changes in their drinking behaviors and habits. If your test shows you have or are at risk for a serious drinking problem, a long-term treatment plan may be recommended. Some questionnaires, including the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), are available online for self-testing. You can ask your provider how to access these tests.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an alcohol use screening test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk in taking a questionnaire.1What do the results mean? Some results may show whether you have AUD. Others may show the level of severity of AUD. For those tests, your results may be in one of the following or similarly named categories: Mild. You may have one or two symptoms of problem drinking. It's not a level that is considered hazardous, a pattern of drinking that puts your health at risk and/or has harmful social effects on you or others. But if you have one or two symptoms now, you may be at risk for developing a more serious problem in the future. Your provider may recommend steps to help you change your drinking habits. Moderate or Hazardous. You have four or five symptoms of a drinking problem. Your provider may recommend a brief intervention or other treatments. Severe or Alcohol Dependent You may need more intensive treatment. This can include seeing a specialist, medication, support groups, and/or addiction recovery programs.1Is there anything else I need to know about an alcohol use screening test? Some people with AUD are able to change their behaviors to cut back on drinking. Other people will need to stop completely. This is known as abstinence. Depending on the severity of your disorder, your provider may recommend one or more of the following treatments: Brief or long-term counseling from a mental health provider who specializes in treating AUD Support groups. There are many different approaches and formats to alcohol use disorder support groups. Talk with your provider to find a group and approach that's right for you. Medication-assisted treatment. Certain medications may reduce your cravings for alcohol. These medicines are only for people who have stopped or are trying to stop drinking altogether.1References AAFP [Internet].

Available from: https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/sbi/en Aldosterone Test : 1What is an aldosterone (ALD) test? An aldosterone test measures the amount of aldosterone (ALD) in your blood or urine (pee). ALD is a hormone made by your adrenal glands, two small glands that sit above your kidneys. ALD helps keep your blood pressure stable. It does this by helping to balance the levels of two electrolytes in your blood, sodium and potassium. If your blood pressure gets too low, ALD signals your kidneys to release more sodium into your blood and to get rid of potassium through urine.  This helps keep more water in your bloodstream, which makes your blood pressure increase. When your blood pressure returns to normal, your ALD levels decrease. Abnormal ALD levels can cause serious health conditions, including: High blood pressure Low blood pressure Complications from abnormal levels of sodium and potassium, which can affect your heart, kidneys and other parts of your body ALD testing may be used with other tests to help diagnose adrenal gland disorders. It can also help find out if other medical conditions are affecting the way your adrenal glands work. An ALD test is commonly combined with a test that measures renin levels in your blood. This is called an aldosterone-renin ratio test. Renin is a hormone that your kidneys make when your blood pressure gets too low. It's part of a complex system that triggers your adrenal glands to make ALD. Comparing renin and ALD levels helps show whether abnormal levels of ALD are caused by a problem with your adrenal glands or a problem with your kidneys or other parts of the system that triggers the production of ALD. Other names: aldosterone, serum; aldosterone urine; aldosterone-renin ratio test; aldosterone-plasma renin activity1What is it used for? An aldosterone (ALD) test is mainly used with a renin test to find out whether too much ALD is the cause of high blood pressure that: Happens with low potassium levels Doesn't improve with usual blood pressure medicines Develops at a young age An ALD test is also used to help: Diagnose adrenal glands disorders Find the cause of an abnormal sodium or potassium levels on an electrolyte test Find the cause of orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure that makes you dizzy when you get up from sitting or lying down)1Why do I need an aldosterone test? You may need this test if your health care provider thinks you may have too much or too little aldosterone (ALD). Signs and symptoms of too much ALD (called hyperaldosteronism or aldosteronism) include: High blood pressure Low potassium test results and/or high sodium test results Muscle weakness, cramps, and/or spasms Fatigue Headache Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Increased thirst and urination Signs and symptoms of too little ALD (called hypoaldosteronism) include: Low blood pressure Test results that show high potassium and/or low sodium levels Fatigue Muscle weakness Loss of appetite Weight loss Abdominal (belly) pain1What happens during an aldosterone test? An aldosterone (ALD) test uses a sample of blood or urine. A test that compares your ALD and renin levels uses a blood sample. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. The amount of ALD in your blood changes depending on whether you are standing up or lying down. So, you may be asked to lie down or stand for a period of time before the test. You may also be tested in both positions. For an ALD urine test, your provider may ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: Urinate (pee) in the toilet as usual.  Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Follow the instructions your provider gives you. You may need to stop taking certain medicines for a period of time before the test. This includes certain over-the-counter medicines. So, be sure to tell your provider everything you're taking. But don't stop taking any prescribed medicine unless your provider tells you to stop. You may also be asked to limit the amount of salt you eat each day for about two weeks before your test. Your provider will explain how to limit salt in your diet. You should not eat natural black licorice for at least two weeks before your test, because it can affect your results. Most licorice products in the United States don't contain natural licorice. But if you eat licorice, check the ingredients label to be sure.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to having a urine test.1What do the results mean? To understand what your test results mean, your provider will consider your aldosterone (ALD) levels along with the results of other tests. Ask your provider to explain what your results say about your health. In general, higher than normal amounts of ALD may mean you have: Primary aldosteronism (also called Conn syndrome). This disorder is usually caused by a benign (not cancerous) tumor on an adrenal gland that produces extra ALD. Secondary aldosteronism. This means that your adrenal glands are healthy, but another medical condition is causing them to make too much ALD. Conditions that can cause high ALD levels include:


Kidney disease
Cirrhosis of the liver
Heart failure
Preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure that that happens in pregnancy
Dehydration

 Kidney disease Cirrhosis of the liver Heart failure Preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure that that happens in pregnancy Dehydration In general, lower than normal amounts of ALD may mean you have: Addison disease (also called adrenal insufficiency). With this condition, damage to your adrenal glands causes low ALD. The damage may be from conditions, such as:


An immune disorder (most common cause)
Certain infections
Cancer cells in the adrenal glands

 An immune disorder (most common cause) Certain infections Cancer cells in the adrenal glands Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This is a group of genetic disorders you're born with. Secondary adrenal insufficiency. This condition starts with a problem in your pituitary, a gland at the base of your brain that controls your adrenal glands. Tertiary adrenal insufficiency. With this condition, low ALD levels are caused by a problem in your hypothalamus, a gland that tells your pituitary when to signal your adrenal glands to make hormones. The most common cause is suddenly stopping steroid medicines after taking them for a long time. Steroids can cause hormonal changes that make your adrenal glands shut down. When you stop taking the steroids, your adrenal glands may be slow to start working again. Low levels of ALD may also be linked to: Certain other health conditions, such as diabetes and lead poisoning Certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, and some heart failure medicines If you have questions about your results and treatment options, talk with your provider.

An alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test measures the amount of ALP in your blood. ALP is an enzyme found  in many parts of your body. Each part of your body produces a different type of ALP. Most ALP is found in your liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system. Abnormal levels of ALP in your blood may be a sign of a wide range of health conditions, including liver disease, bone disorders, and chronic kidney disease. But an alkaline phosphatase test alone can't identify the source of ALP in your blood, so other tests are usually needed to make a diagnosis. Other names: ALP, ALK, PHOS, Alkp, ALK PHOS1What is it used for? An alkaline phosphatase test is often used to screen for or help diagnose diseases of the liver or bones. The test may also help diagnose or monitor other health conditions.1Why do I need an alkaline phosphatase test? Your health care provider may order an alkaline phosphatase test as part of a routine checkup. Many conditions may affect ALP levels, so the test is often done with other blood tests. These other tests include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or liver function tests that check how well your liver is working. An alkaline phosphatase test may also be ordered if you have symptoms of liver damage or a bone disorder. Symptoms of liver disease include: Nausea and vomiting Lack of appetite Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly) Swelling in your ankles and legs Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop) Frequent itching Symptoms of bone disorders include: Pain in your bones Inflammation and arthritis in your joints Bones that are unusually shaped and/or too large Broken bones1What happens during an alkaline phosphatase test? An alkaline phosphatase test is a type of blood test. During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Preparations for an alkaline phosphatase test depend on the lab doing the test. Some labs require you to fast (not eat or drink) for 6 to 12 hours before the test. Also, the ALP test is usually ordered with other blood tests. You usually need to fast for several hours before these tests. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? High alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels may be a sign of a liver problem or a bone disorder. Liver problems and bone disorders cause different types of ALP. But your test results can't tell which type of ALP is high. If your test results show high ALP levels, your provider may order other tests to help figure out what's causing the problem. These tests may include: An ALP isoenzyme test. This test can tell which part of your body is making the ALP. But this test may not available everywhere. Liver function tests. If the results of these tests are also high, then your high ALP level is likely from a problem in your liver. High alkaline phosphatase levels from your liver may be a sign of: Blockages in the bile ducts Cirrhosis Hepatitis Mononucleosis, which can sometimes cause swelling in the liver If alkaline phosphatase levels are high and the results of liver tests are normal, the problem may be a bone disorder, such as Paget's disease of bone. This disease makes your bones unusually large and weak, causing them to break more easily. Moderately high levels of ALP may be a sign of a many different types of conditions, including Hodgkin lymphoma, heart failure, or certain infections. It's possible to have higher than normal levels of ALP and not have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and other test results to make a diagnosis. Low levels of ALP are less common. They may be a sign of a lack of zinc, malnutrition, pernicious anemia, thyroid disease, Wilson disease or hypophosphatasia, a rare genetic disease that affects bones and teeth. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about alkaline phosphatase test? Many things can affect ALP levels. Pregnancy can cause higher than normal ALP levels. Children and teens may have high levels of ALP because their bones are growing. Birth control pills and certain medicines may lower ALP levels, while other medicines can cause the levels to increase. Even eating a fatty meal before an alkaline phosphatase test may also cause a small increase in ALP. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.1References American Liver Foundation.

An allergy blood test measures a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in your blood. IgE is an antibody that your body makes. If you have allergies, you may have more IgE in your blood than normal. Allergies are a common, long-term condition that involves your immune system. Your immune system makes antibodies to fight off viruses, bacteria, and other things that can make you sick. With allergies, your immune system treats one or more harmless substances, such as pollen or peanuts, as a threat.  To fight the "threat," your immune system makes IgE antibodies. This is what causes your allergy symptoms. Harmless substances that may cause allergies are called allergens. Common allergens include: Pollen Dust Mold Animal dander Certain foods, including nuts and shellfish Certain medicines, such as penicillin. Allergy symptoms depend on the type of allergy you have. They can range from itching and sneezing to asthma or a life-threatening condition called anaphylactic shock. Other names: IgE allergy test, Quantitative IgE, Immunoglobulin E, Total IgE, Specific IgE, RAST, CAP, ELISA1What is it used for? Allergy blood tests are used to help find out if you have an allergy. There are two general types of allergy blood tests: A total IgE test is used to measure the total amount of IgE antibodies in your blood. A specific IgE test measures how much IgE your body makes in response to a single allergen. A separate test is done for each allergen that may be causing your allergies.1Why do I need an allergy blood test? Your health care provider may order allergy testing if you have symptoms of an allergy. These include: Stuffy or runny nose Sneezing Itchy, watery eyes Hives (itchy raised red patches on the skin) Diarrhea Vomiting Shortness of breath Coughing Wheezing Your provider may choose to order an allergy blood test if you can't have allergy skin testing. Skin testing involves putting allergens directly on or into your skin. You may not be able to have skin testing if you: Have certain skin conditions Take certain medicines that may affect the results of the test Are likely to have a serious allergic reaction to the allergens used in skin testing In certain cases, providers may order allergy blood tests for young children, because skin testing may be too uncomfortable for them.1What happens during an allergy blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an allergy blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having an allergy blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A total IgE test result that is high means that you may have some kind of allergy. But the results of a total IgE test don't show what you're allergic to or how serious your allergy may be. A specific IgE test result that is high means that you may be allergic to the allergen that was tested. But the amount of IgE measured doesn't predict how serious your allergy may be. If the results from either type of test show that you could have an allergy, your provider may refer you to an allergy specialist or recommend a treatment plan. Your treatment plan will depend on what you are allergic to and how serious your symptoms are. If you're at risk for anaphylactic shock, you'll need to be very careful to avoid the things you are allergic to. You may need to carry an emergency epinephrine treatment (an epinephrine auto-injector) with you at all times. Anaphylactic shock is most common with allergies to certain foods, medicines, insect stings, and latex. Ask your provider if you are at risk for anaphylactic shock and discuss any questions you have about your test results or your allergy treatment plan. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an allergy blood test? Allergy blood tests may not always be accurate. Sometimes the results may say you have an allergy when you actually don't (also known as a false positive). This may happen if your body is having a slight reaction to substances in certain foods that you may have eaten before the test. It's uncommon for a blood test to show that you don't have an allergy when you actually do (also known as a false negative). Depending on your medical history and symptoms, your provider may order an allergy skin test with an allergy blood test, or you may have a skin test alone.1References American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology [Internet].

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=85&contentid=P09504 Allergy Skin Test : 1What is an allergy skin test? An allergy is an overreaction, also known as a hypersensitivity, of the body's immune system. Normally, your immune system works to fight off foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. When you have an allergy, your immune system treats a harmless substance, like dust or pollen, as a threat. To fight this perceived threat, your immune system reacts and causes an allergic reaction. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from sneezing and a stuffy nose to a life-threatening condition known as anaphylactic shock. There are four main types of overreactions, known as Type 1 through Type IV hypersensitivities. Type 1 hypersensitivity causes some of the most common allergies. These include dust mites, pollens, foods, and animal dander. Other types of hypersensitivities cause different immune system overreactions. These range from mild skin rashes to serious autoimmune disorders. An allergy skin test usually checks for allergies caused by Type 1 hypersensitivity. The test looks for reactions to specific allergens that are placed on the skin. Other names: type 1 hypersensitivity skin test, hypersensitivity test allergy scratch test, allergy patch test, intradermal test1What is it used for? An allergy skin test is used to diagnose certain allergies. The test can show which substances (allergens) are causing your allergic reaction. These substances may include pollen, dust, molds, and medicines such as penicillin. The tests are not usually used to diagnose food allergies. This is because food allergies are more likely to cause anaphylactic shock.1Why do I need an allergy skin test? Your health care provider may order allergy testing if you have symptoms of an allergy. These include: Stuffy or runny nose Sneezing Itchy, watery eyes Hives, a rash with raised red patches Diarrhea Vomiting Shortness of breath Coughing Wheezing1What happens during an allergy skin test? You will most likely get tested by an allergist or a dermatologist. You may get one or more of the following allergy skin tests: An allergy scratch test, also known as a skin prick test. During the test: Your provider will place small drops of specific allergens at different spots on your skin. Your provider will then lightly scratch or prick your skin through each drop. If you are allergic to any allergens, you will develop a small red bump at the site or sites within about 15 to 20 minutes. An intradermal test. During the test: Your provider will use a tiny, thin needle to inject a small amount of allergen just below the skin surface. Your provider will watch the site for a reaction. This test is sometimes used if your allergy scratch test was negative, but your provider still thinks you have an allergy. An allergy patch test. During the test: A provider will place small patches on your skin. The patches look like adhesive bandages. They contain small amounts of specific allergens. You'll wear the patches for 48 to 96 hours and then return to your provider's office. Your provider will remove the patches and check for rashes or other reactions.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test. These include antihistamines and antidepressants. Your health care provider will let you know which medicines to avoid before your test and how long to avoid them. If your child is being tested, the provider may apply a numbing cream to his or her skin before the test. 1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having allergy skin tests. The test itself is not painful. The most common side effect is red, itchy skin at the test sites. In very rare cases, an allergy skin test may cause anaphylactic shock. This is why skin tests need to be done in a provider's office where emergency equipment is available. If you've had a patch test and feel intense itching or pain under the patches once you are home, remove the patches and call your provider.1What do the results mean? If you have red bumps or swelling at any of the testing sites, it probably means you are allergic to those substances. Usually the larger the reaction, the more likely you are to be allergic. If you are diagnosed with an allergy, your provider will recommend a treatment plan. The plan may include: Avoiding the allergen when possible Medicines Lifestyle changes such as reducing dust in your home If you are at risk for anaphylactic shock, you may need to carry an emergency epinephrine treatment with you at all times. Epinephrine is a drug used to treat severe allergies. It comes in a device that contains a premeasured amount of epinephrine. If you experience symptoms of anaphylactic shock, you should inject the device into your skin, and call 911.1Is there anything else I need to know about an allergy skin test? If you have a skin condition or other disorder that prevents you from getting an allergy skin test, your provider may recommend an allergy blood test instead.1References American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/abq4055 Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker Test : 1What is an AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) tumor marker test? An AFP tumor marker test is a blood test that measures the level of AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) in a sample of your blood. It's usually used to help diagnose certain types of cancer and to check how well treatment is working. AFP is a protein that the liver makes when its cells are growing and dividing to make new cells. AFP is normally high in unborn babies. After birth, AFP levels drop very low. Healthy children and adults who aren't pregnant have very little AFP in their blood. AFP in non-pregnant people is mainly measured as a tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances that are often made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer. High levels of AFP can be a sign of cancer of the liver,  ovaries or testicles. An AFP tumor marker test cannot be used by itself to screen for or diagnose cancer. That's because other conditions can increase AFP levels, including liver diseases that aren't cancer. And some people who do have liver, ovarian, or testicular cancer will have normal AFP levels. So, an AFP tumor marker test can't rule out cancer for sure. But when used with other tests and exams, AFP tumor marker testing can help diagnose and monitor cancers that cause high AFP levels. Other names: total AFP, alpha-fetoprotein-L3 Percent1What is it used for? An AFP tumor marker test may be used during the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles that make high levels of AFP. It is used to: Help confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis when used with other exams and tests. Predict how cancer may behave over time. Monitor cancer treatment. AFP levels often go up if cancer is growing and go down when treatment is working. Check whether cancer has returned after treatment. In certain cases, results from an AFP tumor marker test may be used to guide treatment choices for specific types of cancer. The test may also be used to monitor your health if you have chronic (long lasting) hepatitis  or cirrhosis of the liver. These conditions aren't cancer, but they increase your risk of developing liver cancer.1Why do I need an AFP tumor marker test? You may need an AFP tumor marker test if: A physical exam and/or other tests suggest that you may have cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles. You are currently being treated for a cancer that causes high AFP levels. Measuring your AFP test can show how well your treatment is working. You have completed treatment for a cancer that increased your AFP level. You may need an AFP tumor marker test from time to time to check whether your cancer is coming back. If you have chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, you have a higher risk of developing liver cancer. A very high level of AFP or a sudden increase can be an early sign of liver cancer. Most medical experts don't recommend measuring AFP levels to screen for cancer in these diseases. But, some health care providers may still use an AFP tumor marker test with other tests to watch for liver cancer.1What happens during an AFP tumor marker test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an AFP tumor marker test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you haven't been diagnosed with cancer, test results that show: High levels of AFP may be a sign of cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles. But having a high AFP level doesn't mean you have cancer or that you will get cancer. Liver injury and liver diseases that aren't cancer can also cause high AFP levels. Less often, high levels of AFP may be a sign of other cancers, including lymphoma or lung cancer. Your provider will use your medical history and other test results to make a diagnosis. Normal levels of AFP mean you're less likely to have a cancer that causes high AFP levels. But a normal test result doesn't rule out cancer because some people with these cancers have normal AFP levels. If you're being treated for a cancer that increased your AFP levels, you may be tested several times during treatment. Your provider will look at all your AFP test results to see how your levels have changed over time. If your results show: Your AFP levels are increasing, it may mean that your treatment isn't working. Your AFP levels are decreasing, it may mean your treatment is working. Your AFP levels have stayed the same, it may mean your disease is stable and hasn't gotten better or worse. If you've finished treatment for cancer that caused high AFP levels and your test results are: Not normal, it may mean that you still have some cancer in your body. Higher now than they were shortly after treatment, it may mean your cancer is growing again. If you have a long-lasting liver disease that's not cancer, you may need other tests to check for liver cancer if your test results show a sudden increase in AFP or your level is very high. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean for your health. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an AFP tumor marker test? In the U.S., the most common AFP tumor marker test measures all forms of AFP in your blood. A less common AFP test may be used to check the risk of liver cancer in people who have chronic liver disease. It measures a form of AFP called L3. An AFP-L3 percent test (AFP-L3%) compares the amount of L3 to the amount of total AFP in your blood. If the portion of L3 increases, it may mean you have a high risk of developing a serious form of the most common liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. You may have heard of another type of AFP test that's used during pregnancy. This test measures total AFP levels in the blood, but it's not a tumor marker test for cancer. It's used to check for the risk of certain birth defects in an unborn baby.1References American Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: American Cancer Society Inc.; c2022.

This test measures the amount of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood. AAT is a protein that is made in the liver. It helps protect your lungs from damage and diseases, such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
 AAT is made by certain genes in your body. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your parents. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color. Everyone inherits two copies of the gene that makes AAT, one from their father and one from their mother. If there is a mutation (change) in one or both copies of this gene, your body will make less AAT or AAT that doesn't work as well as it should. If you have two mutated copies of the gene, it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45. If you have one mutated AAT gene, you may have lower than normal amounts of AAT, but mild or no symptoms of disease. People with one mutated gene are carriers of AAT deficiency. This means you don't have the condition, but you could pass the mutated gene on to your children. An AAT test can help show if you have the genetic mutation that puts you at risk for disease. Other names: A1AT, AAT, alpha-1-antiprotease deficiency, α1-antitrypsin1What is it used for? An AAT test is most often used to help diagnose AAT deficiency in people who develop lung disease at an early age (45 years or younger) and do not have other risk factors such as smoking.
 The test may also be used to diagnose a rare form of liver disease in infants.1Why do I need an AAT test? You may need an AAT test if you are under the age of 45, are not a smoker, and have symptoms of lung disease, including: Wheezing Shortness of breath Chronic cough Faster than normal heartbeat when you stand up Vision problems Asthma that doesn't respond well to treatment You may also get this test if you have a family history of AAT deficiency. AAT deficiency in babies often affects the liver. So your baby may need an AAT test if his or her health care provider finds signs of liver disease. These include: Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes that lasts for more than a week or two An enlarged spleen Frequent itching1What happens during an AAT test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an AAT test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little  risk to a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show a lower than normal amount of AAT, it probably means you have one or two mutated AAT genes. The lower the level, the more likely it is you have two mutated genes and AAT deficiency. If you are diagnosed with AAT deficiency, you can take steps to reduce your risk of disease. These include: Not smoking. If you are a smoker, quit smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking is the leading risk factor for life-threatening lung disease in people with AAT deficiency. Following a healthy diet Getting regular exercise Seeing your health care provider regularly Taking medicines as prescribed by your provider If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an AAT test? Before agreeing to be tested, it may help to speak with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. A counselor can help you understand the risks and benefits of testing. If you are tested, a counselor can help you understand the results and provide information on the condition, including your risk of passing the disease on to your children.1References Lab Tests Online [Internet].

An AFP test is a test that is mainly used to measure the level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood of a pregnant person. The test checks the baby's risk for having certain genetic problems and birth defects. An AFP test is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. AFP is a protein that a developing baby makes. Normally, some AFP passes from the baby into the pregnant person's blood. Certain conditions can make a baby's body release more or less AFP. During pregnancy, if your AFP blood levels are higher or lower than normal, it may be sign that: The baby has a high risk of having a genetic disorder, such as:


A neural tube defect, which is a serious condition that causes abnormal development of a developing baby's brain and/or spine.
Down syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and other health problems.

 A neural tube defect, which is a serious condition that causes abnormal development of a developing baby's brain and/or spine. Down syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and other health problems. Your estimated due date is wrong. AFP levels normally rise and fall at set times during pregnancy, so an abnormal AFP may mean that your baby is due earlier or later than estimated. This is the most common reason for abnormal AFP levels. You're pregnant with more than one baby. Each baby makes AFP, so your AFP blood levels will be higher with two or more babies. Other names: AFP Maternal; Maternal Serum AFP; msAFP screen1What is it used for? An AFP blood test is used during pregnancy to check the baby's risk of birth defects and genetic disorders, such as neural tube defects or Down syndrome. The test does not diagnose any health conditions. If your AFP test results aren't normal, it means you need more testing to find out whether your baby has a health problem. For people who aren't pregnant, an AFP test may be used to help diagnose certain cancers that may cause high AFP levels in adults. When the test is used this way, it's called an AFP tumor marker test.1Why do I need an AFP test? If you are pregnant, AFP test is routinely offered between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy. Your provider may especially recommend the test if you: Have a family history of birth defects Are 35 years or older Have diabetes Have used medicines or drugs during pregnancy that could harm the baby1What happens during an AFP test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparation for an AFP test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to you or your baby with an AFP blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The most common cause for abnormal AFP test results during pregnancy is an error estimating your due date. But a result that isn't normal may also be a sign of possible problems: Lower than normal AFP levels may mean your baby has a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and health problems. Higher than normal AFP levels may mean your baby has an increased risk of having a neural tube defect, such as:

Spina bifida, a condition in which the bones of the spine don't close around part of the spinal cord
Anencephaly, a condition in which the brain does not develop properly

 Spina bifida, a condition in which the bones of the spine don't close around part of the spinal cord Anencephaly, a condition in which the brain does not develop properly High AFP levels may also mean that you are having more than one baby. You may also get a false-positive result. That means that your AFP results aren't normal, but your baby is healthy. If your AFP test results aren't normal, you will likely have more tests to help make a diagnosis. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an AFP test? AFP tests are often part of a group of prenatal tests called multiple marker or triple screen tests. These tests can help diagnose Down syndrome, trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and other genetic disorders. A triple screen test includes tests for: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a hormone produced by the placenta Estriol, a form of estrogen made by the baby and the placenta In some cases, a fourth test is included, called an inhibin A test, which helps diagnose Down syndrome. If you have a high risk for having a baby with certain birth defects, your provider may also recommend a test called prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening.  This is blood test can be done as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. It can show if your baby has a higher chance of having Down syndrome or certain other genetic disorders.1References Adigun OO, Yarrarapu SNS, Khetarpal S. Alpha Fetoprotein.

It is an enzyme found mostly in the liver. An ALT test measures the amount of ALT in the blood. When liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease. Some types of liver disease cause high ALT levels before you have symptoms of the disease. So, an ALT blood test may help diagnose certain liver diseases early. Other names: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT), GPT1What is it used for? An ALT blood test is often part of a routine blood screening to check the health of your liver. The test may also help diagnose or monitor liver problems.1Why do I need an ALT blood test? Your health care provider may order an ALT blood test, as part of a routine checkup. An ALT test is usually done with a group of other liver function tests that check how well your liver is working. These tests may also be ordered if you have symptoms of liver damage, such as: Nausea and vomiting Lack of appetite Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly) Swelling in your ankles and legs Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop) Frequent itching Your provider may also order an ALT blood test if you have a high risk for liver damage because of: A family history of liver disease Alcohol abuse disorder (AUD) Obesity Diabetes Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis1What happens during an ALT blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an ALT blood test. But an ALT test is usually ordered with other blood tests. You usually need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before these tests. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? An ALT blood test is often done as part of a group of liver function tests. Liver function tests measure several different proteins, substances, and enzymes that show how well your liver is working. Your provider usually compares your ALT results with the results of the other liver tests to evaluate your liver health and to decide if you need other tests to make a diagnosis. In general, high levels of ALT may be a sign of liver damage from hepatitis, infection, cirrhosis, liver cancer, or other liver diseases. The damage may also be from a lack of blood flow to the liver or certain medicines or poisons. If your results show you have a high level of ALT, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many things can affect your results, such as your age, sex, certain medicines and dietary supplements, intense exercise, how much you weigh, and having a menstrual period. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. And be sure tell your provider about all the medicines and supplements you take. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an ALT blood test? ALT test results may help tell the difference between damage from acute (sudden) liver problems and chronic (long-term) liver problems. But the amount of ALT in your blood isn't related to how much your liver may be damaged. ALT used to be called SGPT, which stands for serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase. The ALT blood test was formerly known as the SGPT test.1References American Liver Foundation. [Internet]. New York: American Liver Foundation; c2022. .

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid=alt_sgpt Ammonia Levels : 1What is an ammonia levels test? This test measures the level of ammonia in your blood. Ammonia, also known as NH3, is a waste product made by your body during the digestion of protein. Normally, ammonia is processed in the liver, where it is changed into another waste product called urea. Urea is passed through the body in urine. If your body can't process or eliminate ammonia, it builds up in the bloodstream. High ammonia levels in the blood can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage, coma, and even death. High ammonia levels in the blood are most often caused by liver disease. Other causes include kidney failure and genetic disorders. Other names: NH3 test, blood ammonia test, serum ammonia, ammonia; plasma1What is it used for? An ammonia levels test may be used to diagnose and/or monitor conditions that cause high ammonia levels. These include: Hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that happens when the liver is too diseased or damaged to properly process ammonia. In this disorder, ammonia builds up in the blood and travels to the brain. It can cause confusion, disorientation, and coma. It can sometimes be fatal. Reye syndrome, a serious and sometimes fatal condition that causes damage to the liver and brain. It mostly affects children and teenagers who are recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or the flu and have taken aspirin to treat their illnesses. The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. But because of the risk, children and teens should not take aspirin unless specifically recommended by your health care provider. Urea cycle disorders, rare genetic defects that affect the body's ability to change ammonia into urea. The test may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for liver disease or kidney failure.1Why do I need an ammonia levels test? You may need this test if you have liver disease and are showing symptoms of a brain disorder. Symptoms include: Confusion Excessive sleepiness Disorientation, the condition of being confused about time, place, and/or your surroundings Mood swings Hand tremors Your child may need this test if he or she has symptoms of Reye syndrome. These include: Vomiting Sleepiness Irritability Seizures Your newborn baby may need this test if he or she has any of the above symptoms. The same symptoms may be a sign of a urea cycle disorder.1What happens during an ammonia levels test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. To test a newborn, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You should not exercise or smoke cigarettes for about eight hours before an ammonia test. Babies do not need any special preparations before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You or your child may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show high ammonia levels in the blood, it may be a sign of one of the following conditions: Liver diseases, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis Hepatic encephalopathy Kidney disease or kidney failure In children and teens, it may be a sign of Reye syndrome. In infants, high ammonia levels may be a sign of a genetic disease of the urea cycle or a condition called hemolytic disease of the newborn. This disorder happens when a mother develops antibodies to her baby's blood cells. If your results were not normal, your health care provider will need to order more tests to find out the reason for your high ammonia levels. Your treatment plan will depend on your specific diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an ammonia levels test? Some health care providers think blood from an artery may provide more useful information about ammonia than blood from a vein. To get a sample of arterial blood, a provider will insert a syringe into the artery in your wrist, elbow crease, or groin area. This method of testing is not used very often.1References American Liver Foundation. [Internet]. New York: American Liver Foundation; c2017.

Amniocentesis is a test done during pregnancy to diagnose certain genetic disorders, birth defects, and other conditions in an unborn baby. The test is usually done between weeks 15 and 20 of pregnancy. Amniocentesis looks at a sample of amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid is a clear or pale yellow liquid that surrounds and protects an unborn baby throughout pregnancy. The fluid contains cells that provide important information about your unborn baby's health. Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test. That means it will tell you whether your baby has a specific health problem, and the results are almost always accurate. Diagnostic tests are different from prenatal screening tests for genetic disorders. Prenatal screening tests have no risks for you or your baby, but they don't diagnose problems. They can only show if your baby might have a health problem. If a screening test shows your baby could have a problem, your health care provider may recommend amniocentesis or another diagnostic test to find out for sure. Other names: amniotic fluid analysis1What is it used for? Amniocentesis is used to diagnose certain health problems in an unborn baby. It is commonly used to find: Genetic and chromosomal disorders, including:

Down syndrome, a disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and other health problems
Cystic fibrosis, a disease of the mucus and sweat glands that causes thick sticky mucus, which can lead to problems with breathing and digestion
Sickle cell disease, a group of red blood cell disorders that can cause anemia and other health problems
Tay-Sachs disease, a disease that destroys nerve cells, causes mental and physical problems, and often death in early childhood (uncommon)

 Down syndrome, a disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and other health problems Cystic fibrosis, a disease of the mucus and sweat glands that causes thick sticky mucus, which can lead to problems with breathing and digestion Sickle cell disease, a group of red blood cell disorders that can cause anemia and other health problems Tay-Sachs disease, a disease that destroys nerve cells, causes mental and physical problems, and often death in early childhood (uncommon) Neural tube defects, severe birth defects of the baby's brain and/or spine, such as spina bifida and anencephaly. The test may also be used to: Check your baby's lung development if you have a risk for giving birth too soon (premature birth). In this case, amniocentesis is done later in pregnancy. Diagnose an infection or certain other illnesses in the baby1Why do I need amniocentesis? Having amniocentesis is your choice. You may want this test if you have a high risk for having a baby with a health problem. You may have an increased risk if: You are age 35 or older. (The risk of having a baby with a genetic disorder increases with age.) You had a prenatal screening test that shows your baby might have a problem. You or your partner have a family history of a genetic disorder or neural tube defect. You or your partner had genetic testing that showed you carry a genetic disorder. You or your partner have a child with a genetic disorder or birth defect. Amniocentesis isn't right for everyone. Before you decide to get tested, think about how you'd feel and what you might do after learning the results.1What happens during amniocentesis? The test is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. It is sometimes done later in pregnancy to check the baby's lung development or diagnose certain infections or illnesses, such as anemia in the unborn baby caused by Rh incompatibility. During the procedure: You'll lie on your back on an exam table. Your provider may apply a numbing medicine to your abdomen. Your provider will move an ultrasound wand-like device, called a transducer, on your belly. Ultrasound uses sound waves to show the position of your baby and placenta so your provider can see where to take a sample of amniotic fluid. Your provider will insert a thin needle into your abdomen and withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid. When the sample is removed, your provider will check your baby's heartbeat with the ultrasound. The procedure usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you may be told to avoid any hard exercise or physical activity for the next 24 hours.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you are early in your pregnancy, you may need avoid urinating (peeing) before the test to make sure that you have a full bladder. This helps move the uterus into a better position for the test. In later pregnancy, the test requires an empty bladder1Are there any risks to the test? You may have feel mild stinging, pressure, and/or cramping during. Afterwards, you may have mild discomfort or vaginal bleeding, or a small amount of amniotic fluid that leaks from the vagina. The risk of serious complications is extremely low. Amniocentesis does have a very slight risk (less than 1 percent) of causing a miscarriage.1What do the results mean? Amniotic fluid may be tested for many different disorders. Your test results will depend on which tests your provider ordered. Normal results are reported as "normal" or "negative." This means that it's very unlikely that your baby has the disorder that was tested, but it does not guarantee your baby will not have any health problems. Results that are not normal are reported as "abnormal" or "positive." This means that your baby very likely has the disorder that was tested. Your provider will explain your test results. Amniocentesis is very accurate, but in certain cases, your provider may order more tests to learn about your baby's health. It may help to speak to a genetic counselor before testing and/or after you get your results. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing who can help you understand what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about amniocentesis? In some cases, you may want information about your unborn baby sooner than 15 to 20 weeks, when amniocentesis is usually done. In that case, you might consider another diagnostic test called a chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test takes a small sample of tissue from the placenta You can have a CVS test between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy, which gives you more time to decide what to do if the results are abnormal. Like amniocentesis, CVS is an accurate diagnostic test that can find certain genetic disorders. But it has a slightly higher risk of miscarriage. As you make decisions about testing, keep in mind that prenatal genetic diagnostic tests are different from screening  tests. Screening tests estimate the chances that your unborn baby may have certain problems. It's possible to have an abnormal screening test when your baby is actually healthy. But if a screening test shows that your baby has a risk for certain problems, you may have amniocentesis or CVS to find out for sure.1References ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw1810 Amylase Test : 1What is an Amylase Test? An amylase test measures the amount of amylase in your blood or urine (pee). Amylase is an enzyme, or special protein, that helps you digest carbohydrates. Most of the amylase in your body is made by your pancreas and salivary glands. A small amount of amylase in your blood and urine is normal. But having too much or too little may be a sign of a disorder of the pancreas or salivary glands, or another medical condition. Other names: Amy test, serum amylase, urine amylase1What is it used for? Tests for amylase in blood or urine are mainly used to diagnose problems with your pancreas, including pancreatitis, which is an inflammation of the pancreas. It is also used to monitor chronic (long-term) pancreatitis. Increases and decreases in amylase levels show up in blood before urine, so an amylase urine test may be done with or after an amylase blood test. One or both types of amylase test may also be used to help diagnose or monitor treatment for other disorders that may affect amylase levels, such as salivary gland disorders and certain digestive conditions.1Why do I need an amylase test? Your health care provider may order an amylase blood and/or urine test if you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder. Symptoms may begin suddenly or slowly and include: Pain in your upper abdomen (belly) that may spread to your back or get worse after eating Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Fever Fast heartbeat Jaundice Greasy, foul-smelling stool (poop) Your provider may also order an amylase test to monitor an existing condition that affects the pancreas, including: Chronic pancreatitis Pancreatic cancer Eating disorders Cystic fibrosis Alcohol use disorder Recovery from having gallstones removed after a gallbladder attack1What happens during an amylase test? For an amylase blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For an amylase urine test, you will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test. Your provider may request that you collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. That's because the amount of amylase in urine can vary throughout the day. So, collecting several samples in a day may give a more accurate picture of your amylase levels. For this test, you will be given a container and specific instructions on how to collect your sample at home. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully. In certain cases, your provider may order a test for amylase in peritoneal fluid. This is fluid between the layers of the tissue that line the inside of your abdomen (belly) and cover most of your organs. To get a sample, a health care professional will numb your skin and use a needle and tubing to draw some fluid into a container.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You should not drink alcohol for 24 hours before having an amylase blood or urine test. If you are having a blood test, your provider may also tell you to fast (not eat or drink) for two hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. During a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no known risk to having a urine test. If you have a peritoneal fluid test, you may feel a little dizzy or lightheaded after the procedure. There is a small risk of the needle damaging your bowel or bladder, which may lead to bleeding or infection.1What do the results mean? High levels of amylase in blood or urine may be a sign of: Acute (sudden) pancreatitis A blockage in a duct (small tube) in the pancreas Pancreatic cancer or benign (not cancer) tumor High levels of amylase in peritoneal fluid may be a sign of: Acute pancreatitis A blocked intestine Lack of blood flow to the intestines Low levels of amylase in blood or urine are uncommon, but may be a sign of: Chronic pancreatitis causing permanent damage to the cells that make amylase Kidney disease Cystic fibrosis Liver disease Pre-eclampsia (a type of high blood pressure in pregnancy) Be sure to tell your provider about any prescription or over-the-counter medicines you are taking because they may affect your test results. To learn more about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an amylase test? If your provider suspects you have pancreatitis, he or she may order a lipase blood test, along with an amylase blood test. Lipase is another enzyme produced by the pancreas. Lipase tests are considered to be more accurate for diagnosing pancreatitis, especially when pancreatitis is caused by alcohol use disorder.1References Akinfemiwa O, Muniraj T. Amylase.

An ANA test is a blood test that looks for antinuclear antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. But an antinuclear antibody attacks your own healthy cells instead. It's called "antinuclear" because it targets the nucleus (center) of the cells. It's normal to have a few antinuclear antibodies in your blood. But a large number may be a sign of an autoimmune disorder. If you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system attacks the cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. These disorders can cause serious health problems. Other names: antinuclear antibody panel, fluorescent antinuclear antibody, FANA, ANA, ANA reflexive panel1What is it used for? An ANA test is used to help diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common type of lupus. Lupus is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that affects many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, and brain. Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that mostly affects joints, causing pain and swelling often in the wrists, hands, and feet. Scleroderma, a rare disease that may affect the skin, blood vessels, and organs. Sjögren's syndrome, a rare disease that affects the glands that make tears and saliva (spit) and other parts of the body. Addison Disease, which affects your adrenal glands, causing fatigue and weakness. Autoimmune hepatitis, which causes swelling in your liver.1Why do I need an ANA test? Your health care provider may order an ANA test if you have symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. The symptoms depend on the part of the body that's affected. They may include: Fever Rash, blisters, or skin color changes Fatigue Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling Muscle pain1What happens during an ANA test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an ANA test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Results from an ANA test alone cannot diagnose a specific disease. Your provider will use your ANA test results along with other tests and information about your health to make a diagnosis. A negative result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were not found in your blood, and you're less likely to have an autoimmune disorder. But a negative ANA test doesn't completely rule out the possibility that you could have an autoimmune disorder. A positive result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were found in your blood. A positive result may be a sign of: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) A different type of autoimmune disease A viral infection (antinuclear antibodies from a virus are usually temporary) Another health condition that can cause antinuclear antibodies, such as cancer. If your ANA test results are positive, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis. Having antinuclear antibodies in your blood doesn't always mean you have a disease. Some healthy people have antinuclear antibodies in their blood, and levels tend to increase with age. As many as one-third of healthy adults over the age of 65 may have a positive ANA test result. Also, certain medicines can cause antinuclear antibodies. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References American College of Rheumatology [Internet]. Atlanta: American College of Rheumatology; c2022.

An anion gap blood test is a way to check the acid-base balance (pH balance) of your blood. It tells you if your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough. The test uses the results of another blood test called an electrolyte panel. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals in your body, such as sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate. They help control the acid-base balance of your blood. Some electrolytes have a positive electric charge. Others have a negative electric charge. The anion gap measures the difference—or gap—between the negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes in your blood. If the anion gap is too high, your blood is more acidic than normal. If the anion gap is too low, your blood isn't acidic enough. Both high and low results may be signs of a serious disorder in your body that needs attention. Other names: Serum anion gap1What is it used for? The anion gap blood test shows whether your electrolytes are out of balance or if your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough. Too much acid in the blood is called acidosis. Too little acid in your blood is called alkalosis. Both conditions can be serious.1Why do I need an anion gap blood test? Your health care provider may order an anion gap blood test if you have symptoms that your blood acidity may not be normal. These symptoms may include: Shortness of breath Vomiting Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Confusion Fatigue1What happens during an anion gap blood test? The anion gap test is a calculation that's done with the results of an electrolyte panel, which is a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.  After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? There is no special preparation necessary for an anion gap blood test. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having this test. You may feel slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Several types of medical conditions can cause abnormal anion gap test results. Your provider will use the results of the anion gap test, your medical history, and other tests to make a diagnosis. A high anion gap test result may mean that you may have acidosis (blood that is more acidic than normal). Acidosis may be caused by: Dehydration Diarrhea Too much exercise Kidney diseases Diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis) Certain medicines and poisons A low anion gap test result may mean you have alkalosis (blood that is less acidic than normal). But this result is so rare that your provider will usually have you tested again to make sure the results are accurate. The most common cause of a low anion gap is a low level of albumin, a protein in the blood. Low albumin may be a sign of not eating enough protein, kidney problems, liver disease, heart disease, or some types of cancer. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an anion gap blood test? The anion gap blood test provides information about the acid-base balance of your blood. This tells you about the health of many of your body functions. But there is a wide range of normal results and many possible causes of abnormal results. So, talk with your provider about what your test results mean and whether you need additional testing to make a diagnosis.1References ChemoCare.com [Internet].

An anoscopy is a procedure that uses a small tube called an anoscope to view the lining of your anus and rectum. A related procedure called high resolution anoscopy uses a special magnifying device called a colposcope along with an anoscope to view these areas. The anus is the opening of the digestive tract where the stool leaves the body. The rectum is a section of the digestive tract located above the anus. It's where stool is held before it exits the body through the anus. An anoscopy can help a health care provider find problems in the anus and rectum, including hemorrhoids, fissures (tears), and abnormal growths.1What is it used for? An anoscopy is most often used to diagnose: Hemorrhoids, a condition that causes swollen, irritated veins around the anus and lower rectum. They can be inside the anus or on the skin around the anus. Hemorrhoids are usually not serious, but they can cause bleeding and discomfort. Anal fissures, small tears in the lining of the anus Anal polyps, abnormal growths on the lining of the anus Inflammation. The test can help find the cause of unusual redness, swelling, and/or irritation around the anus. Cancer. High resolution anoscopy is often used to look for cancer of the anus or rectum. The procedure can make it easier for your health care provider to find abnormal cells.1Why do I need an anoscopy? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a problem in your anus or rectum. These include: Blood in your stool or on toilet paper after a bowel movement Itching around the anus Swelling or hard lumps around the anus Painful bowel movements1What happens during an anoscopy? An anoscopy may be done in a provider's office or outpatient clinic. During an anoscopy: You will put on a gown and remove your underwear. You will lie on an exam table. You will either lie on your side or kneel on the table with your rear end raised in the air. Your provider will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your anus to check  for hemorrhoids, fissures, or other problems. This is known as digital rectal exam. Your provider will then insert a lubricated tube called an anoscope about two inches into your anus. Some anoscopes have a light on the end to give your provider a better view of the anus and lower rectum area. If your provider finds cells that don't look normal, he or she may use a swab or other tool to collect a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). High resolution anoscopy may be better than regular anoscopy at finding abnormal cells. During a high resolution anoscopy: Your provider will insert a swab coated with a liquid called acetic acid through the anoscope and into the anus. The anoscope will be removed, but the swab will remain. The acetic acid on the swab will cause abnormal cells to turn white. After a few minutes, your provider will remove the swab and reinsert the anoscope, along with a magnifying instrument called a colposcope. Using the colposcope, your provider will look for any cells that have turned white. If abnormal cells are found, your provider will take a biopsy.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may want to empty your bladder and/or have a bowel movement before the test. This may make the procedure more comfortable. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having an anoscopy or a high resolution anoscopy. You may have some discomfort during the procedure. You may also feel a little pinch if your provider took a biopsy. In addition, you may have a little bleeding when the anoscope is pulled out, especially if you have hemorrhoids.1What do the results mean? Your results may show a problem with your anus or rectum. These may include: Hemorrhoids Anal fissure Anal polyp Infection Cancer. The biopsy results can confirm or rule out cancer. Depending on the results, your provider may recommend more tests and/or treatment options.11References Colon and Rectal Surgery Associates [Internet].

An anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) test measures the amount of AMH in a blood sample. In males, AMH is made by the testicles (or testes), which are glands that make sperm and male hormones. In females, the ovaries make AMH.  The ovaries are glands where eggs form and female hormones are made. AMH plays different roles in males and females and normal levels of AMH vary with your sex and your age. Measuring AMH levels can provide information about a variety of reproductive health conditions. In unborn babies, AMH helps form the male and female reproductive organs. The sex of unborn babies is set by the chromosomes they inherit from their parents.  Male babies have XY chromosomes and female babies have XX chromosomes. But the development of their reproductive organs and genitals is affected by hormones, including AMH. In the early weeks of pregnancy, both male and female babies have a set of ducts (tubes) called Müllerian ducts. Normally, male babies make high levels of AMH in their testicular tissue. The AMH makes the Müllerian ducts shrink and helps male organs to grow. AMH levels stay high in male children until puberty when they begin to decrease. Unborn female babies have very low levels of AMH. This allows the Müllerian ducts to develop into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and the upper part of the vagina. AMH stays low in female children. At puberty, follicles inside the ovaries begin to make more AMH. Follicles are small sacs in the ovaries that hold immature eggs. In healthy females of childbearing age, higher levels of AMH mean that the ovaries have a larger supply of eggs. As females age, the number of eggs decreases, which causes AMH levels to decrease. At menopause, no eggs are left, and AMH levels drop to zero. Other names: AMH hormone test, müllerian-inhibiting hormone, MIH, müllerian inhibiting factor, MIF, müllerian-inhibiting substance, MIS1What is it used for? AMH tests are mainly used with other tests to make decisions about treating female infertility (not being able to get pregnant). If you're having infertility treatment, AMH testing can: 
Check how many eggs you have left in your ovaries. This is called your "ovarian reserve." It's normal for your ovarian reserve to decrease with age. An AMH test can tell you the size of your ovarian reserve, but it can't tell you about the health of your eggs or predict whether you'll be able to get pregnant.

An AMH test can tell you the size of your ovarian reserve, but it can't tell you about the health of your eggs or predict whether you'll be able to get pregnant. 
Predict how well you may respond to fertility medicine. Normally, your ovaries prepare one egg for fertilization each month. If you're using in vitro fertilization (IVF) to have a baby, your health care provider will prescribe fertility medicine to make your ovaries prepare many eggs at the same time. The eggs are removed and mixed with sperm to make embryos outside of your body. Then the embryos are either frozen or put into the uterus to start a pregnancy.
Testing your AMH level helps your provider know what dose of fertility medicine you may need to get the best response.

Testing your AMH level helps your provider know what dose of fertility medicine you may need to get the best response. In females, AMH testing may also be used to: 
Find out if you're getting close to menopause or have already begun menopause. As you approach menopause your egg supply shrinks and AMH levels drop. AMH levels can be used to check for premature menopause (before age 40) and early menopause (before age 45). But an AMH test can't predict when you'll actually reach menopause. The average age of menopause is 52.
 Find out if you're getting close to menopause or have already begun menopause. As you approach menopause your egg supply shrinks and AMH levels drop. AMH levels can be used to check for premature menopause (before age 40) and early menopause (before age 45). But an AMH test can't predict when you'll actually reach menopause. The average age of menopause is 52. Help diagnose and monitor problems with the ovaries that cause high AMH levels.
 These include:


Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that can cause infertility
Certain types of ovarian cancer

 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that can cause infertility Certain types of ovarian cancer For babies and children, an AMH test may be used: 
To check for healthy testicles in a male baby or child that may have undescended testicles. This is a condition where the testicles fail to move from the belly, where they develop before birth, into their proper place in the scrotum. Healthy testicles in a male baby produce AMH. So, normal AMH levels mean that the baby has healthy, working testicles, but they just haven't dropped into the scrotum. Little to no AMH is a sign of other conditions that need more testing.

To learn more about a baby born with genitals that aren't clearly male or female. This condition is called "atypical genitalia." In the past, it has been called "ambiguous genitalia" or "intersex." There are many types of atypical genitalia that have different causes. For example, problems with AMH and other hormones in a male baby can lead to the development of internal female reproductive organs and external genitals that don't look typical.
An AMH test can show whether the baby has any working testicular tissue. This information can help diagnose the cause of the problem. The test is usually done with other tests, including chromosome testing, other hormone tests, and ultrasound scans to check for sex organs and glands inside the body.

If you're female, you may need an AMH test if you: Are having fertility problems. You may need an AMH test to:

Find out if your egg supply is normal for your age.
Plan in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Higher levels of AMH mean that you're likely to respond to fertility medicine and you may only need a small dose. Low levels of AMH may mean need higher doses to respond.

Higher levels of AMH mean that you're likely to respond to fertility medicine and you may only need a small dose. Low levels of AMH may mean need higher doses to respond. Have symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including:

Irregular menstrual periods, or no periods at all (amenorrhea)
Acne
Too much hair on the face, chest, stomach, or thighs
Hair loss on the head (male pattern baldness)
Weight gain
Dark patches of skin

 Irregular menstrual periods, or no periods at all (amenorrhea) Acne Too much hair on the face, chest, stomach, or thighs Hair loss on the head (male pattern baldness) Weight gain Dark patches of skin Are being treated for certain types of ovarian cancer. AMH testing can show if your treatment is working. After treatment the test can show whether cancer has returned. A male baby or child who doesn't have testicles in the scrotum may need an AMH test to help find out if there are healthy testicles inside the body. A baby with genitals that aren't clearly male or female may need an AMH test along with other tests to help diagnose the cause of the disorder and confirm the sex.1What happens during an AMH test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an AMH test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? What the AMH test results mean depends on the reason the test was done: If you're healthy and trying to get pregnant, ask your provider to explain what your AMH test results mean for your fertility based on your age and other test results. In general, a high level of AMH means you have more eggs available, and a low level means your egg supply is shrinking and your time to get pregnant may be shorter. If you were tested for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a high level of AMH is a sign that you may have the disease. An AMH test alone cannot diagnose PCOS. There is no cure for PCOS, but symptoms can be managed with medications and/or lifestyle changes. If you were tested for menopause, low AMH may mean you're getting close to menopause. But AMH test results can't predict how long you have until menopause. If your test result showed no AMH in your blood, it means you are in menopause. If you're younger than age 40 and have symptoms of menopause, an AMH level that's lower than average for your age may be a sign of primary ovarian insufficiency. If you are being treated for ovarian cancer, a decrease in AMH usually mean that your treatment is working. If AMH increases, it may mean your treatment isn't working or cancer has returned. If a male baby or child is tested for undescended testicles: Normal AMH levels mean the baby has working testicles, but they are not in the right location. This condition can be treated with surgery and/or hormone therapy. Little or no AMH may mean the testicles are not working or missing completely. This may be caused by a change (mutation) in the AMH gene. The baby may have atypical internal female reproductive organs with normal male genitals. If a baby is tested because of genitals that aren't clearly male or female, the meaning of AMH test results depends on the results of other tests. If you have questions about test results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing [Internet].

Antibiotics are medicines used to fight bacterial infections. There are different types of antibiotics. Each type is only effective against certain bacteria. An antibiotic sensitivity test can help find out which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection. The test can also be helpful in finding a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when standard antibiotics become less effective or ineffective against certain bacteria. Antibiotic resistance can turn once easily treatable diseases into serious, even life-threatening illnesses.  Other names: antibiotic susceptibility test, sensitivity testing, antimicrobial susceptibility test1What is it used for? An antibiotic sensitivity test is used to help find the best treatment for a bacterial infection. It may also be used to find out which treatment will work best on certain fungal infections.1Why do I need an antibiotic sensitivity test? You may need this test if you have an infection that has been shown to have antibiotic resistance or is otherwise hard to treat. These include tuberculosis, MRSA, and C. diff. You may also need this test if you have a bacterial or fungal infection that is not responding to standard treatments.1What happens during an antibiotic sensitivity test? The test is done by taking a sample from the infected site. The most common types of tests are listed below. Blood culture

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Your health care provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

 Your health care provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? There are no special preparations needed for an antibiotic sensitivity test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood culture test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a throat culture, but it may cause slight discomfort or gagging. There is no risk to having a urine, sputum, or wound culture.1What do the results mean? Results are usually described in one of the following ways: Susceptible. The tested medicine stopped the growth or killed the bacteria or fungus causing your infection. The medicine may be a good choice for treatment. Intermediate. The medicine may work at a higher dose. Resistant. The medicine did not stop the growth or kill the bacteria or fungus causing the infection. It would not be a good choice for treatment. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about an antibiotic sensitivity test? Incorrect use of antibiotics has played a big role in the rise in antibiotic resistance. Make sure you use antibiotics the right way by: Taking all doses as prescribed by your provider Only taking antibiotics for bacterial infections. They don't work on viruses, like colds and flu.

Antibody serology tests check for the presence or level of specific antibodies in the blood. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances. These substances are often pathogens, (disease-causing germs) such as viruses and bacteria. When you have an infection, your body makes antibodies that are targeted to those pathogen. These antibodies may protect you from getting another infection or from getting severe symptoms. A vaccine can also provide protection by triggering your immune system to make antibodies to  pathogen. An antibody serology test can show that your immune system can fight off certain diseases.  Other names: antibody titer test, antibody test, antibody serum test 1What are they used for? Antibody serology tests are used to look for antibodies to specific diseases. These include: COVID-19 Measles and mumps Varicella zoster virus, which includes chickenpox and shingles Hepatitis Mononucleosis The tests may also be used to check for certain antibodies that may be a sign of an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases cause your immune system to attack your own cells, tissues, and/or organs by mistake. Antibody serology tests are not used to diagnose diseases. They can show that you have antibodies to a disease. But they can't show if the antibodies are from a current or past infection or from a vaccination.1Why do I need an antibody serology test? You may need this test: To find out if you've had a recent or past infection. To check your vaccination status. If your medical records are incomplete, you may need this test to find out if you've been vaccinated. To find out if a vaccine is effective. If you've already been vaccinated against a disease, the test can show if your vaccine is providing enough protection. As a requirement for your school or job. Some organizations may require proof of past infection or vaccination. To find out if you have an autoimmune disease, such as lupus.1What happens during an antibody serology test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You don't need any special preparations for an antibody serology test.1Are there any risks to this test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will depend on which antibodies were measured. Results may be given as titers (levels of antibodies) or as positive (you have antibodies) or negative (you do not have antibodies). Common results include: Antibodies to a specific pathogen were found. This may mean you had a previous infection. It could also mean you've been vaccinated against a certain disease. Low levels of certain antibodies were found. This may mean a previous vaccination is not providing you with enough protection against a disease. It also means you may need a booster shot. Autoantibodies were found. Autoantibodies are a type of antibody that attacks healthy cells by mistake. This may mean you have an autoimmune disease. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an antibody serology test? Antibody serology tests can show that you have an immune response to a pathogen. But they cannot show if you have full protection from a disease or how long the protection lasts. In the case of a newer disease like COVID-19, it is not yet known how long protection lasts after being infected or vaccinated.1References Familydoctor.org [Internet].

This test looks for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in a sample of your blood. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. But sometimes antibodies attack the healthy cells of your own tissues and organs by mistake. This is called autoimmune disease. ANCAs attack healthy white blood cells called neutrophils. This can lead to a disorder called autoimmune vasculitis. There are several types of autoimmune vasculitis, but they all cause inflammation and swelling in your blood vessels. When this happens, your blood vessels can narrow or close off. This can cause different types of serious health problems depending on which blood vessels in your body are affected. There are two main kinds of ANCA called pANCA and cANCA. Each type targets a specific protein inside white blood cells. An ANCA test can show whether you have one or both types of antibodies. This information helps your health care provider diagnose which type of autoimmune vasculitis you have so you can get the right treatment. Testing for pANCA can also help diagnose certain types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a group of chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune diseases that cause swelling and irritation in your stomach and intestines. Other names: ANCA antibodies, cANCA, pANCA, cytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies, serum, anticytoplasmic autoantibodies1What is it used for? ANCA testing is used to help: Find out if you have autoimmune vasculitis and which type. Monitor treatment for autoimmune vasculitis. Diagnose whether you have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Both conditions are types of inflammatory bowel disease. ANCAs are more commonly found in ulcerative colitis. Types of autoimmune vasculitis include: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). This condition used to be called Wegener's disease. It most often affects blood vessels in the lungs and/or sinuses. It may also affect the nose, windpipe, or kidneys. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). This disorder can affect several parts of the body, including the lungs, kidneys, nerves, skin, and joints. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). This condition used to be called Churg Strauss syndrome. It usually affects blood vessels in the lungs and/or sinuses. It may also affect the stomach and intestines, skin, heart, and nervous system. It often causes asthma and a high level of white blood cells called eosinophils.1Why do I need an ANCA test? If you have symptoms of autoimmune vasculitis, you may need an ANCA test. Symptoms may develop slowly or quickly. They may be mild or severe. General symptoms may include: Fatigue Fever General aches and pains Loss of appetite Weight loss Other symptoms depend on which type of vasculitis you have and which parts of your body are affected. Symptoms in some commonly affected areas include: Eyes, ears, and nose

Changes in vision or loss of vision
Red and/or itching, burning eyes
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)

 Open sores in the mouth Diarrhea Vomiting blood You may also need an ANCA test if you have symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which may include: Abdominal (belly) pain Diarrhea Weight loss Blood in stool (poop) Fever1What happens during an ANCA test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for an ANCA test. But ANCA testing may be done with other blood tests. Your provider will let you know if you need to prepare.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider will consider the results of your ANCA test along with your symptoms and the results of other tests. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean. If you were tested for autoimmune vasculitis: A negative result means that no ANCAs were found in your blood sample. Your symptoms probably aren't caused by autoimmune vasculitis. A positive result means that ANCAs were found in your blood sample. This may mean you have autoimmune vasculitis. Your test results will also show which type of ANCAs were found. This can help diagnose the type of vasculitis you have. If ANCA antibodies are found, another test may be done on your blood sample to see how much ANCA is in your blood. You will often need other blood tests and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue or cells for testing. The tissue sample will be taken from a blood vessel that is swollen. If you were tested to monitor treatment for autoimmune vasculitis, ANCA test results may show whether your treatment is working. But this test isn't always an accurate way to measure how much disease you have. If you were tested for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), your provider will consider your ANCA test results along with the results from another antibody blood test. This test checks for an antibody called ASCA (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies). ASCA are common in people with IBD.  You may have: Ulcerative colitis if ANCA was found, but ASCA was not found. Crohn's disease if ANCA was not found, but ASCA was found. If neither antibody was found, you may still have IBD. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Allina Health [Internet].

Appendicitis is an inflammation (swelling) or infection of your appendix. Your appendix is a small finger-like pouch attached to your large intestine. It's located in the lower right side of your abdomen (belly). The cause of appendicitis isn't always clear. Your appendix may become inflamed or infected if something blocks the opening where it attaches to your intestine. If appendicitis isn't treated promptly, your appendix can burst and spread bacteria in your abdomen. This can lead to a life-threatening bacterial infection. A burst appendix can also cause a pus-filled infection in your appendix called an abscess. Appendicitis typically causes abdominal (belly) pain in your right side. But some people may have different symptoms because their appendix isn't in the usual place. This can make appendicitis hard to diagnose. Appendicitis tests help your health care provider make an accurate diagnosis quickly so you can get proper care. Appendicitis tests may include: Blood tests to look for signs of infection and inflammation that may mean you have appendicitis. But blood tests can't diagnose appendicitis. A urine (pee) test to rule out a urinary tract infection and/or a kidney stone. These conditions can cause symptoms similar to appendicitis. Imaging tests to take pictures of your appendix. If your symptoms and other tests suggest that you have appendicitis, imaging tests can confirm the diagnosis. Appendicitis can happen at any age, but it's more common in people in their teens and twenties. The main treatment for appendicitis is an appendectomy, which is surgery to remove the appendix. Your appendix has no known function, and you don't need it to be healthy.1What are they used for? Appendicitis tests are used to confirm or rule out a problem with the appendix in people who have appendicitis symptoms.1Why do I need appendicitis testing? You may need testing if you have abdominal (belly) pain that usually: Starts near your belly button and moves lower and to your right Hurts more when you move, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze Gets worse within hours If you have any severe abdominal pain, it's important to get medical help as soon as possible. Along with pain, other appendicitis symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting Fever Loss of appetite Swelling in your abdomen Diarrhea or constipation Problems passing gas1What happens during appendicitis testing? Before ordering appendicitis tests, your provider will ask questions about your symptoms and medical history. You'll also have an exam. If your provider thinks you could have appendicitis, you may have one or more tests to help confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Blood tests can help find out if you have an infection or inflammation in your body, but these tests can't show whether appendicitis is the cause. To collect a blood sample, a health care professional will insert a small needle into a vein in your arm to collect a small amount of blood into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Urine tests can help rule out a urinary tract conditions that could be causing your symptoms. To collect your urine sample, a health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample. Imaging tests check to see if your appendix looks normal. These tests can confirm whether you have appendicitis. They include: CT scan (computed tomography scan). A CT scan is the most accurate imaging test for diagnosing appendicitis. For this test:


A contrast dye may be used to make your tissues and organs show up better in the pictures. The contrast dye may be given as:


A drink that you swallow
An injection into a vein using an intravenous (IV) line
An enema, which is a tube that injects the contrast medium into your intestine through your anus


You will lie still on a table that passes slowly through the center of a large donut-shaped x-ray machine. For some scans, the x-ray machine moves around you to take pictures. You may hear whirring sounds from the machine.

For some scans, the x-ray machine moves around you to take pictures. You may hear whirring sounds from the machine. An ultrasound makes pictures using sound waves. For this test:


You'll lie on an exam table and a healthcare professional will put a special gel on your abdomen.
A handheld wand-like device will be moved across your abdomen and images of your organs will show on a monitor.

 You'll lie on an exam table and a healthcare professional will put a special gel on your abdomen. A handheld wand-like device will be moved across your abdomen and images of your organs will show on a monitor. An MRI scan makes pictures using magnets and a computer. For this test:


You may be given a dye through an intravenous (IV) line.
You'll lie very still on a table that slides into an MRI scanner, which is a tunnel-shaped machine. If you have trouble being in closed-in spaces, talk with your provider about options that may make you more comfortable.
You may be given earplugs or headphones to help block loud sounds from the scanner.

 You may be given a dye through an intravenous (IV) line. You'll lie very still on a table that slides into an MRI scanner, which is a tunnel-shaped machine. If you have trouble being in closed-in spaces, talk with your provider about options that may make you more comfortable. You may be given earplugs or headphones to help block loud sounds from the scanner. If there's a chance you could be pregnant, you will likely have a pregnancy test to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, which can cause pain similar to appendicitis. It's also important to know whether you're pregnant before having a CT scan. That's because the x-rays could harm an unborn baby. A pregnancy test may be done with a blood or a urine test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the tests? Blood and urine tests don't require any special preparations. For imaging tests, you may have to stop eating and drinking for several hours before the test. Your provider will tell you how to prepare.1Are there any risks to the tests? A blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but it usually goes away quickly. A urine test has no risk. Imaging tests are safe. If your test includes contrast dye, there's a small chance you could have an allergic reaction to it. Reactions can often be managed with medicine. If you get the dye through an IV, it may cause a slight burning feeling. 
CT scans are generally safe. They do use x-rays which are a form of radiation. The small amount of radiation in a CT scan is not considered harmful to most adults. But exposure to radiation can slightly increase the risk of developing cancer later in life. Children and unborn babies are more sensitive to radiation than adults because their bodies are still growing.
If you're concerned about radiation exposure for yourself, your unborn baby, or your child, ask about other imaging tests to diagnose appendicitis. If your child needs a CT scan, ask if the machine will be adjusted to use the lowest amount of radiation possible.

 MRI scans are generally very safe. But if you have certain metals and/or implanted medical devices in your body, ask your provider if you can have an MRI.1What do the results mean? To confirm or rule out appendicitis, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of your exam and appendicitis tests. Blood test results: A high white blood cell count means you probably have an infection. But the test results don't show what's causing the infection. It's also possible to have appendicitis with a normal white blood cell count. A high level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood means that you have inflammation in your body that could be from appendicitis. But this test alone can't diagnose appendicitis. Urine test results: A high level of white blood cells or bacteria in your urine may means that a urinary tract infection is causing your symptoms. Blood, crystals or high levels of certain minerals in your urine may mean that kidney stones are causing your symptoms. Imaging test results: An appendix that is blocked, larger than normal, burst, or has an abscess means that you probably have appendicitis. If your appendix looks normal, imaging tests may help find other problems that could be causing abdominal pain. If your provider diagnoses appendicitis, you'll usually have surgery to remove your appendix as soon as possible before it can burst. If your appendix has already burst, you must have surgery right away. The surgeon will remove your appendix and clean the infection from your abdomen.

An arterial blood gas (ABG) test measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. It also checks the acidity of your blood. This is called your acid-base balance or your pH level. The blood sample is taken from an artery, which is a blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from your lungs to your body. In an ABG test, the blood oxygen measurement shows how well your lungs move oxygen from the air into your blood when you breath in. The carbon dioxide measurement shows and how well your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your blood when you breath out. Carbon dioxide is an acidic waste product that your body makes. If your blood and tissues become even slightly too acidic or too basic (alkaline), it can seriously affect many of your organs and even become life-threatening. Your lungs and your kidneys do much of the work to keep your acid-base balance normal. So, the acid-base measurement from an ABG test can help diagnose and monitor conditions that affect your lungs and kidneys as well as many other conditions that may upset your acid-base balance. Other names: blood gas test, arterial blood gases, ABG, oxygen saturation test1What is it used for? An ABG test is used to help: Check your acid-base balance Diagnose serious problems with your lungs and breathing Diagnose kidney disorders Find out whether treatment is working for breathing disorders, kidney disease, or other conditions that may affect your acid-base balance1Why do I need an arterial blood gas (ABG) test? There are many reasons why you may need this test. For example, you may need an ABG test if you: Have symptoms of a problem with your acid-base balance, such as:

Uncontrolled rapid or deep breathing, which may be a sign that your lungs are trying to adjust acids or bases by changing the amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in your blood
Nausea and vomiting
Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)
Confusion
Fatigue
Muscle twitching and/or cramps

 Uncontrolled rapid or deep breathing, which may be a sign that your lungs are trying to adjust acids or bases by changing the amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in your blood Nausea and vomiting Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Confusion Fatigue Muscle twitching and/or cramps Are being treated for a lung disease or a condition that affects your breathing, such as:

Asthma
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Cystic fibrosis
Myasthenia gravis

 Asthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Cystic fibrosis Myasthenia gravis Have symptoms after you have had:

Carbon monoxide poisoning
An inhalation injury (breathing in smoke, hot air, and/or harmful chemicals)
A recent head or neck injury that could affect your breathing

 Carbon monoxide poisoning An inhalation injury (breathing in smoke, hot air, and/or harmful chemicals) A recent head or neck injury that could affect your breathing Are receiving oxygen therapy in the hospital1What happens during a blood oxygen level test? Most blood tests take a sample from a vein. For this test, a health care provider will take a sample of blood from an artery. That's because blood from an artery has higher oxygen levels than blood from a vein. The sample is usually taken from an artery on the inside of your wrist, but it may be taken from an artery in your arm or groin. For a newborn, the sample may be taken from the baby's heel or the umbilical cord shortly after birth. If your blood sample is taken from your wrist, the provider will first test your blood circulation. The provider will hold your wrist and apply pressure to the arteries to cut off blood flow to your hand for several seconds. Then the provider will let go of your wrist to check how quickly blood flow returns to your hand. If your blood flow is normal, the provider will collect a blood sample. A blood sample taken from an artery tends to be more uncomfortable than most blood tests, which use a vein. So, the provider may apply some numbing medicine to your skin first. The provider will insert a needle with a syringe into the artery to remove some blood. When the syringe is full, the provider will bandage the puncture site.  Pressure will be applied to the site for at least 5 minutes to stop the bleeding.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you take blood thinners, including aspirin, ask your health care provider whether you should stop taking them before your test. And tell your provider about all other medicines and supplements you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to. If you are on oxygen therapy, your oxygen may be turned off for about 20 minutes before the test. This will be done only if you can breathe without oxygen therapy.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood oxygen level test. You may have some bleeding, bruising, or soreness at the spot where the needle was put in. Very rarely, the needle may damage a nerve or the artery. You may be told to avoid lifting heavy objects for 24 hours after the test.1What do the results mean? ABG test results involve many body systems that affect each other. And there are many health conditions that can cause abnormal results. For these reasons, it's best to have your provider explain what your results mean for your health. Your ABG test results will list many measurements, including: Oxygen saturation (O2Sat). This measures how much oxygen your red blood cells are carrying Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). This measures the pressure of oxygen that's dissolved in your blood. It helps show how well oxygen moves from your lungs to your bloodstream. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). This measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. It also shows how easily carbon dioxide can move out of your body. Acid-base balance (pH level). This measures the acidity of your blood. Too much acid is called acidosis. Too much base (alkaline) is called alkalosis. These conditions are symptoms of other problems that upset the acid-base balance in your body. An ABG test alone usually can't provide a final diagnosis. So, if your results are not normal, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis. In general, abnormal results may mean you have a problem with your lungs or kidneys or a metabolic disorder. Metabolic disorders affect how your body uses food for energy. Certain medicines may also upset your acid-base balance and lead to abnormal ABG test results. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about blood oxygen level tests? Another type of test, called pulse oximetry, can check your blood oxygen saturation levels. A small clip-like device, called a pulse oximeter, is usually attached to your finger. The device tells you the percentage of red blood cells that are full of oxygen. Pulse oximetry may be useful if blood oxygen levels are the only concern. Ask your provider if this test is right for you.1References American Lung Association [Internet]. Chicago: American Lung Association; c2022.

AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is found mostly in the liver, but it's also in muscles and other organs in your body. When cells that contain AST are damaged, they release the AST into your blood. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease. Other names: SGOT test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase test; aspartate transaminase test1What is it used for? An AST blood test is often part of a routine blood screening to check the health of your liver. The test may help diagnose or monitor liver problems. It may also help diagnose other health conditions.1Why do I need an AST blood test? You may get an AST blood test as part of your routine checkup or if you have symptoms of liver damage. These may include: Nausea and vomiting Lack of appetite Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly) Swelling in your ankles and legs Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop) Frequent itching Even if you don't have symptoms, your health care provider may order an AST blood test if you're more likely to develop liver disease because of: A family history of liver disease Alcohol use disorder Obesity Diabetes Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis1What happens during an AST blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an AST blood test. But an AST test is usually ordered with other blood tests. You usually need to fast (not eat or drink) for up to 12 hours before these tests. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? High levels of AST in the blood may be a sign of hepatitis, cirrhosis, mononucleosis, or other liver diseases. High AST levels may also be a sign of heart problems or pancreatitis. If your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many things can affect your results, such as certain medicines and your age, sex, and diet. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an AST blood test? Your health care provider may order an ALT blood test with your AST blood test. ALT stands for alanine transaminase, which is another type of liver enzyme. If you have high levels of AST and/or ALT, it may mean that you have some type of liver damage. You may also have an AST test as part of a group of liver function tests that measure ALT, and other enzymes, proteins, and substances in the liver.1References American Liver Foundation. [Internet].

At-home medical tests, also known as home use tests, are kits you can buy online or at your local pharmacy or supermarket. The kits allow you to test for, screen, or monitor certain diseases and conditions in the privacy of your own home. Common at-home tests include: Pregnancy tests Glucose (blood sugar) tests, which may be used on a regular basis to help manage diabetes Fecal occult blood test, which screens for colon cancer Tests that check for signs of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, HIV, and COVID-19 Genetic tests that may show if you are at higher risk for certain diseases. Most test kits involve taking a sample of a body fluid, such as blood, urine, or saliva, and applying it to the kit as directed. Some tests provide immediate results, while others need to be packaged and mailed to a lab. Many kits are available without a prescription, but you should still ask your health care provider for advice on which kits to use. Other names: home use tests, home test kits1How are they used? At-home testing is frequently used to: Find or screen for disorders, such as high cholesterol or certain infections, before you have symptoms. This may allow you to get treatment earlier and avoid serious complications. It may also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Help diagnose pregnancy early, so you can take immediate steps to protect your health and the health of your baby. Monitor chronic diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. This may allow you to make prompt changes in treatment and/or lifestyle to improve your condition.1How do I use an at-home test? Instructions will vary depending on the type and brand of test kit. Below are examples of some common at-home tests and how they are performed. Used to diagnose pregnancy by checking for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is normally only produced during pregnancy. Test procedure:


You will hold a test strip in your urine stream or collect your urine in a cup and place the test strip into the cup.
If you are pregnant, the strip will display a colored line, a double line, or a symbol such as a plus sign. The type of display depends on the brand.

Follow up with your health care provider if the test is positive, or if the test was negative but you still think you might be pregnant. Used to monitor blood sugar levels. This test is essential for some people with diabetes. If glucose gets too high or too low, it can cause dangerous complications. Test procedure:


You will prick your finger with a device called a lancet to get a drop of blood.
You place the blood on a test strip and insert it into a monitor.
The meter will show your glucose level.
There are different types of glucose meters. Each work in slightly different ways. Some may not even require you to prick your finger. Be sure to read and follow all the instructions carefully.

You will mail the sample to the test company or as directed. The testing company or your provider will contact you with the results. If you are using a test to find out your risk of disease, be sure to talk to your health care provider. These tests can't diagnose diseases and are not as accurate as traditional lab-based genetic tests. But if a home test shows you may be at higher risk, your provider can monitor your health more closely. You may be able to use an at-home test for COVID-19. Check the CDC for the latest information these tests.111111Is there anything else I need to know about at-home medical tests? At-home medical tests can provide helpful information, but they are not a replacement for guidance and treatments by a health care provider. After at-home testing, you should follow up with your provider regardless of the result. In addition, when purchasing and using an at-home test kit: Only use FDA-approved or FDA-authorized tests. The FDA has strict requirements for quality and accuracy in home test kits. Follow test instructions exactly. Even minor changes can affect your results. Don't buy or use expired tests. Chemicals in the test may lose their effectiveness over time.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995–2021.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder of the brain that affects a person's behavior, communication, and social skills. The disorder usually shows up in the first two years of life. ASD is called a "spectrum" disorder because there is a wide range of symptoms. Autism symptoms can range from mild to severe. Some children with ASD may never be able to function without support from parents and caregivers. Others need less support and may eventually live independently. ASD screening is the first step in diagnosing the disorder. While there is no cure for ASD, early treatment can help reduce autism symptoms and improve quality of life. Other names: ASD screening1What is it used for? Autism spectrum disorder screening is most often used to check for signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children aged 2 and under.1Why does my child need an autism spectrum disorder screening? The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for ASD at their 18-month and 24-month well-child checkups. Your child may need screening at an earlier age if he or she has symptoms of ASD. Autism symptoms may include: Not making eye contact with others Not responding to a parent's smile or other gestures A delay in learning to talk. Some children may repeat words without understanding their meaning. Repeated body movements such as rocking, spinning, or flapping of hands Obsession with specific toys or objects Trouble with change in routine Older children and adults may also need screening if they have autism symptoms and were not diagnosed as babies. These symptoms may include: Trouble communicating Feeling overwhelmed in social situations Repeated body movements Extreme interest in specific topics1What happens during an autism spectrum disorder screening? There is no special test for ASD. Screening usually includes: A questionnaire for parents that asks for information about their child's development and behavior. Observation. Your child's provider will look at how your child plays and interacts with others. Tests that ask your child to perform tasks that check their thinking skills and ability to make decisions. Sometimes a physical problem can cause autism-like symptoms. So screening may also include: Blood tests to check for lead poisoning and other disorders Hearing tests. A hearing problem can cause problems in language skills and social interaction. Genetic tests. These tests look for inherited disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X causes intellectual disabilities and symptoms similar to ASD. It most often affects boys.1Will I need to do anything to prepare my child for an autism spectrum disorder screening? There are no special preparations needed for this screening.1Are there any risks to a screening? There is no risk to having an autism spectrum disorder screening.1What do the results mean? If results show signs of ASD, your provider may refer you to specialists for more testing and/or treatment. These specialists may include a: Developmental pediatrician. A doctor who specializes in treating children with special needs. Neuropsychologist. A doctor who specializes in understanding the relationship between the brain and behavior. Child psychologist. A health care provider who specializes in treating mental health and behavioral, social, and development issues in children. If your child is diagnosed with ASD, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible. Early treatment can help make the most of your child's strengths and abilities. Treatment has been shown to improve behavior, communication, and social skills. ASD treatment involves services and support from a variety of providers and resources. If your child is diagnosed with ASD, talk to his or her provider about making a treatment strategy.1Is there anything else I need to know about autism spectrum disorder screening? There is no one single cause of autism spectrum disorder. Research suggests that it is caused by a combination of factors. These may include genetic disorders, infections, or medicines taken during pregnancy, and an older age of one or both parents (35 or older for women, 40 or older for men). Research also clearly shows that there is no link between childhood vaccines and autism spectrum disorder. If you have questions about ASD risk factors and causes, talk to your child's health care provider.1References Au AH, Shum KK, Cheng Y, Tse HM, Wong RM, Li J, Au TK.

Autonomic testing helps find out if your autonomic nervous system (ANS) is working as well as it should. Your ANS controls body functions that happen automatically (without you thinking about them). These include breathing, heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. If there are problems with the function of the ANS, it's known as autonomic neuropathy.  The most common causes of autonomic neuropathy include diabetes, autoimmune diseases, some types of medicines, and certain infections, such as HIV/AIDS. Autonomic testing can show which part of the ANS is affected and how seriously it's affected. This can help your provider develop the most effective treatment strategy. Other names: tilt table test, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART), thermoregulatory sweat test (TST)1What is it used for? Autonomic testing is used to check for problems with your autonomic nervous system (ANS).1Why do I need autonomic testing? You may need this test if you have symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. Symptoms will vary depending on which part of the nervous system is affected. Stomach and gastrointestinal symptoms include: Constipation Diarrhea Nausea and vomiting Bladder and urinary symptoms include: Difficulty urinating Leaking urine Urinating more often than usual Heart and lung symptoms include: Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath with activity or exercise Dizziness Fainting Weakness Other symptoms include: Too much or not enough sweating Sexual problems; erectile dysfunction in men; vaginal dryness in women1What happens during autonomic testing? There are different types of autonomic tests. Depending on your symptoms, your health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests: Deep Breathing Test and Valsalva Maneuver. These tests measure your heart rate and blood pressure while doing certain types of breathing. For both tests, a provider will place electrodes on your chest and a small blood pressure cuff on your finger. For a deep breathing test, you will take slow, deep breaths for one minute. For the Valsalva maneuver, you will breathe out forcefully through a mouthpiece while your nose is pinched shut. The electrodes and cuff will record your heart rate and blood pressure. Tilt Table Test. This test measures your blood pressure and heart rate as you change your posture and position. During the test: You will lie flat on a motorized table that has a footrest. Soft safety straps will be placed across your body. A health care provider will put electrodes on your chest and blood pressure cuffs on one of your arms and a finger. An IV line may also be placed in your arm or hand to inject medicine or fluids if needed. You will remain flat on the table for about 15 minutes. A health care provider will tilt the table to an almost standing position for up to 45 minutes. Your provider will check your blood pressure and heart rate. If the test causes you to faint, the table will be quickly returned to the flat position. Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART). This test measures the function of the nerves that control sweating. During the test: Your provider will place electrodes on your foot, arm, and leg. The electrodes will contain a substance that stimulates sweating. A mild electrical current will be sent through the electrodes. You might feel a warm, tingling sensation as this is done. A computer will analyze how your nerves and sweat glands react to the electrical current. The test takes about 45 minutes to an hour to complete. Thermoregulatory Sweat Test (TST). This test measures how well your body sweats in 
a warm environment. During the test: A special powder will be applied to your skin. You will lie in a special room that will be slowly heated up to stimulate sweating. The heat and humidity may be a little uncomfortable. The powder will change color as you sweat. The pattern of your sweat can show if you are sweating normally. The test takes usually takes 40-65 minutes to complete. Bladder Ultrasound. This test is used to check for problems with your bladder, which is controlled by autonomic nerves. The ultrasound is done after you urinate to see how much urine is left in the bladder. During the test: You will lie on a table with your lower abdomen exposed. A health care provider will spread a special gel on the skin over that area. The provider will move a wand-like device, called a transducer, over the area. The device sends sound waves into your body. The waves are recorded and turned into images on a monitor.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your health care provider will give you specific instructions on how to prepare, but many autonomic tests require the following preparations: Don't eat or drink anything with caffeine for eight hours before your test. Keep well hydrated with noncaffeinated beverages the day before your test. Don't drink alcohol for 12 hours before your test. Don't smoke for three hours before your test. Your provider will also let you know if you need to stop taking certain medicines before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? Some people faint during a tilt table test. If that happens, you will be tilted back to a normal position immediately. During and after a tilt table test, you may experience nausea or vomiting and weakness. Weakness may last for a couple of hours, but other symptoms usually go away quickly. There are no known risks to having ultrasound or sweat tests.1What do the results mean? If any of your autonomic test results were not normal, your provider may recommend medicine and/or lifestyle changes to treat the disease that is causing your symptoms. Your provider may also recommend treatment strategies to help manage your symptoms. If the cause of your autonomic neuropathy is unknown, you may need more tests to help make a diagnosis.11References Center for Peripheral Neuropathy [Internet]. Chicago: University of Chicago; c2021.

There are many different kinds of bacteria. They live just about everywhere in your body and on your skin. Some types of bacteria are harmless or even helpful. Others can cause infections and disease. A bacteria culture test can help find harmful bacteria in or on your body that may be making you sick. To do the test, you will need to give a sample of your blood, urine, skin, or other tissue. The type of sample depends on where the infection seems to be located. To find out what type of bacteria you may have, a health care professional will need to examine a large number of bacteria cells. So, your sample will be sent to a lab where the bacteria cells will be grown until there are enough for the test. Test results are often ready within a few days. But some types of bacteria grow slowly, so sometimes your results may take several days or longer.1What is it used for? Bacteria culture tests are used to help diagnose certain types of infections. The most common types of bacteria tests and their uses are: Throat Culture Used to diagnose or rule out strep throat Test procedure:


A health care professional uses a special swab to take a sample from the back of your throat and tonsils.

Used to help diagnose bacterial or fungal infections in your respiratory tract, such as bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and histoplasmosis. Test procedure:


You provide a sputum sample, usually by coughing it up into a special cup. In certain cases, you may need to have a bronchoscopy to get a sample. A bronchoscopy involves inserting a flexible tube through your nose or mouth and into your lungs.

Used to detect bacterial infections in your digestive system, including food poisoning. Because many things can cause digestive illness, this test is often done with other tests to look for viruses and parasites that may be causing symptoms. Test procedure:


You provide a sample of your feces in a clean container.

 You provide a sample of your feces in a clean container. Wound Culture Used to find infections in open wounds or on burn injuries Test procedure:


A health care professional uses a special swab to collect a sample of cells or pus from your wound. For deeper wounds, a syringe may be used to draw out fluid, or you may have a biopsy to remove a piece of tissue from the wound.

Your provider may order a bacteria culture test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection. The symptoms vary, depending on the type of infection.1Why do I have to wait so long for my results? Bacteria culture tests require a large number of cells to accurately identify what type of bacteria may be causing an infection. Most test samples don't include enough cells for that. So your sample is sent to a lab to allow the cells to grow until there are enough to test. Most disease-causing bacteria will be ready for testing within one to two days, but some types of bacteria take five days or longer to grow enough cells.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? There are many different types of bacteria culture tests. Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a swab or blood test or to providing a urine or stool sample.1What do the results mean? If harmful bacteria are found in your sample, it usually means you have a bacterial infection. Your provider may order more tests to confirm the diagnosis or to see how serious the infection is. Your provider may also order a test to find out which medicine will work best to treat the type of bacteria you have. This test is called an antibiotic sensitivity test or a susceptibility test. It checks to see how sensitive the bacteria are to different antibiotic medicines. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I should know about a bacteria culture? If your results show you don't have a bacterial infection, you should not take antibiotic medicines. Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections. Taking antibiotics when you don't need them won't help you feel better and may lead a serious problem known as antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance allows harmful bacteria to change in a way that makes antibiotics less effective or not effective at all. This can be dangerous to you and your community, because antibiotic-resistant bacteria can spread to others.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=85&contentid=P00961 Bacterial Vaginosis Test : 1What is a bacterial vaginosis (BV) test? Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a bacterial infection in the vagina. A healthy vagina contains a balance of both "good" (healthy) and "harmful" (unhealthy) bacteria. Normally, the good bacteria keep the harmful type under control. A BV infection happens when the normal balance is upset and more harmful bacteria grow than good bacteria. A BV test checks a sample of vaginal discharge (fluid that comes out of the vagina) to look for harmful bacteria. Any woman can get BV, even women who have never had sex. But it's most common in women who are sexually active. Sometimes a BV infection doesn't cause symptoms, and it can go away on its own. But serious health problems are linked to untreated BV. If you have symptoms, testing and treatment can help avoid the increased risk of these problems: Getting a sexually transmitted disease (STD). BV makes your vagina more acidic than normal, which increases your chance of getting STDs, such as chlamydia, genital herpes, gonorrhea, or HIV. And if you have HIV and BV, you're more likely to pass HIV to your sex partner. Preterm birth. If you have a BV infection during pregnancy, it can increase the chance that your baby will be born too early (premature baby) or have a low birth weight (less than 5 and a half pounds). Low birth weight can cause serious health problems for your baby, including difficulty breathing, gaining weight, and fighting infections. There are different ways to check a sample of vaginal discharge for signs of BV: Using a microscope. This is called a "vaginal smear" or a "wet mount." The sample is prepared on a glass slide and checked under a microscope for bacteria, white blood cells, and other cells that are signs of infection. Checking for odor. This is called a "whiff test." The sample is mixed with a chemical to see if it makes a strong, fishy odor, which is a sign of BV. Testing vaginal pH. This test checks the acidity of the sample. High acidity is a sign of BV. But a pH test alone can't diagnose BV, so it's used with other tests. PCR test. This test checks your sample for genetic material from harmful bacteria. It's not used as much as the other three tests, because it's more expensive. Other names: vaginal pH test, KOH test, wet mount test1What is it used for? A BV test is used to find out if a BV infection is the cause of symptoms that appear to be from a vaginal infection.1Why do I need a BV test? You may need testing if you have symptoms of BV. These include: An unusual vaginal discharge that can be gray or white. It may also be foamy or watery. A strong, fish-like odor, especially after sex Pain and/or itching in the vagina Itching around the outside of the vagina Burning feeling when urinating (peeing) You may also need a test if you have a female sex partner who has BV or symptoms that could be BV.1What happens during a BV test? A BV test is done much like a pelvic exam: You'll take off your clothes below your waist and wear gown or use a sheet as a cover. You'll lie on an exam table with your feet in stirrups. Your health care provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to gently widen your vagina so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will use a cotton swab or wooden stick to collect a sample of your vaginal discharge. Your provider may examine the sample or send it to a lab for testing. At-home test kits are available to test for the bacteria that cause BV. The kits include everything you need to collect a sample of vaginal fluid and send it a lab for testing. To get proper care, share your results with your provider. There are also at-home vaginal pH test kits.  These kits use a swab or paper strip that changes color after you moisten it with vaginal fluid. A chart shows you what the color means. A high pH (high acidity) is a sign that you may have BV, but it doesn't mean you have BV for sure. And a normal pH doesn't mean you don't have BV. So, discuss your results with your provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Follow the instructions your provider gives you to prepare for this test. For 24 hours before your test, you'll usually need to avoid: Using tampons Douching (rinsing the vagina with water or other fluid) Using creams or medicines in the vagina Having vaginal sex1Are there any risks to the test? With a BV test from your provider, you may feel some mild discomfort when the speculum is put in your vagina.1What do the results mean? Abnormal results from a vaginal smear or a whiff test mean that you have a bacterial infection. The results of a vaginal pH test will be a number that shows how acidic your vagina is. A pH over 4.5 is high, which means you're more likely to have BV. But a pH test can't diagnose BV. If your results show you have a BV infection, your provider will probably prescribe antibiotic pills and/or antibiotic creams or gels that you put in your vagina.  Medicines that treat BV are safe to use during pregnancy. Sometimes a BV infection will come back after successful treatment. If this happens, your provider may prescribe different medicine or a different dose of the medicine you took before. There are no over-the-counter treatments for BV. Treatments for vaginal yeast infections will not help BV and could make your symptoms worse. So, don't try to treat an infection yourself. If your results show you don't have BV, your provider may do more tests to find the cause of your symptoms. If you have questions about your results, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a BV test? BV is not spread through sex between female and male partners. So, if you're diagnosed with BV and have a male sex partner, he will not need to be tested. But the infection can be spread between female sex partners. If you have an infection and your partner is female, she should get a BV test. Researchers aren't sure how BV spreads, but there are steps you can take that may lower your risk of infection: Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex Don't use douches Use condoms every time you have sex1References ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Available from: https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/bacterial-vaginosis Balance Tests : 1What are balance tests? Balance tests are a group of tests that check for balance disorders. A balance disorder is a condition that makes you feel unsteady on your feet and dizzy. Dizziness is a general term for different symptoms of imbalance. Dizziness can include vertigo, a feeling that you or your surroundings are spinning, and lightheadedness, a feeling like you are going to faint. Balance disorders can be mild, or so severe that you may have trouble walking, climbing stairs, or doing other normal activities. Different systems in your body need to work together for you to have good balance. The most important system is called the vestibular system. This system is located in your inner ear and includes special nerves and structures that help you keep your balance. Your vision and sense of touch are also essential for good balance. Problems with any of these systems can lead to a balance disorder. Balance disorders can happen at any age, but are more common in older people. It's one of the main reasons that older adults tend to fall more often than younger people. Other names: vestibular balance testing, vestibular testing1What are they used for? Balance tests are used to find out if you have a problem with your balance, and if so, what is causing it. There are many causes of balance disorders. They include: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Your inner ear contains calcium crystals, which help control balance. BPPV happens when these crystals get shifted out of position. It can make you feel like the room is spinning or your surroundings are moving. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo in adults. Meniere's disease. This disorder causes dizziness, bouts of hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Vestibular neuritis. This refers to an inflammation inside the inner ear. It is usually caused by a virus. Symptoms include nausea and vertigo. Migraines. A migraine is a type of throbbing, severe headache. It is different than other types of headaches. It can cause nausea and dizziness. Head injury. You may get vertigo or other balance symptoms after a head injury. Medicine side effect. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medicines. Once you learn the cause of your balance disorder, you can take steps to help manage or treat your condition.1Why do I need a balance test? You may need a balance test if you have symptoms of a balance disorder. Symptoms include: Dizziness Feeling like you are in motion or spinning, even when standing still (vertigo) Loss of balance while walking Staggering while walking Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Feeling like you are going to faint (lightheadedness) and/or a floating sensation Blurred vision or double vision Confusion1What happens during a balance test? Balance testing may be done by a primary health care provider or a specialist in disorders of the ear. These include: An audiologist, a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and managing hearing loss. An otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor specializing in treating diseases and conditions of the ears, nose, and throat. Diagnosing balance disorders usually requires several tests. You may get one or more of the following tests: Electronystagmography (ENG) and videonystagmography (VNG) tests. These tests record and measure your eye movements. Your vision system needs to work right for you to have good balance. For an ENG test, electrodes (small sensors that stick to the skin) will be placed over the skin around your eyes. For a VNG test, special goggles will be placed on your eyes. Both tests include the following steps: You will sit in an exam chair in a dark room. You will be asked to look at and follow patterns of light on a screen. You will be asked to move into different positions as you watch this light pattern. Then warm and cool water or air will be put in each ear. This should cause the eyes to move in specific ways. If the eyes don't respond in these ways, it may mean there is damage to the nerves of the inner ear. Rotary test, also known as a rotary chair test. This test also measures your eye movements. During this test: You will sit in a computer-controlled, motorized chair. You will put on special goggles that will record your eye movements as the chair slowly moves back and forth and in a circle. Posturography, also known as computerized dynamic posturography (CDP). This test measures your ability to maintain balance while standing. During this test: You will stand barefoot on a platform, wearing a safety harness. There will be a landscape screen around you. The platform will move around to test your ability to remain standing on a moving surface. Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) test. This test measures how certain muscles respond in reaction to sound. It can show if there is a problem in your inner ear. During this test: You will recline in a chair. You will put on earphones. Sensor pads will be attached to your neck, forehead, and under your eyes. These pads will record your muscle movements. Clicks and/or bursts of tones will be sent to your earphones. While the sound is playing, you'll be asked to lift your head or eyes for short periods of time. Dix hallpike maneuver. This test measures how your eye reacts to abrupt movements. During this test: Your provider will move you quickly from sitting to lying down position and/or move your head in different positions. Your provider will check your eye movements to see if you have a false sense of motion or spinning. A newer version of this test is called a video head impulse test (vHIT). During a vHIT test, you'll wear goggles that record your eye movements while a provider gently turns your head in different positions. You may also get one or more hearing tests, since many balance disorders are related to hearing problems.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a balance test? You should wear loose, comfortable clothes. Depending on the test, you may need to make changes in your diet or avoid certain medicines for a day or two before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to balance tests? Certain tests may make you feel dizzy or nauseous. But these feelings usually go away within a few minutes. You may want to make arrangements for someone to drive you home, in case the dizziness lasts for a longer period of time.1What do the results mean? If your results were not normal, your provider may order more tests and/or put you on a treatment plan. Depending on the cause of your balance disorder, your treatment may include: Medicine to treat an infection. Medicine to help control dizziness and nausea. Positioning procedure. If you were diagnosed with BPPV, your provider may perform a series of specialized movements of your head and chest. This can help reposition particles in your inner ear that have gotten out of place. The procedure is also known as the Epley maneuver, or canalith repositioning. Balance retraining therapy, also known as vestibular rehabilitation. A provider specializing in balance rehabilitation may design a program of exercises and other steps to improve your balance and prevent falls. This may include learning to use a cane or a walker. Diet and lifestyle changes. If you were diagnosed with Meniere's disease or migraine headaches, certain lifestyle changes may ease your symptoms. These can include increasing physical activity, avoiding certain foods, and quitting smoking. Ask your health care provider about which changes may be best for you. Surgery. If medicines or other treatments are not working, you may need surgery to correct a problem in your inner ear. The type of surgery will depend on the specific cause of your balance disorder. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1References American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) [Internet].

A barium swallow, also called an esophagogram, is an imaging test that checks for problems in your upper GI tract. Your upper GI tract includes your mouth, back of the throat, esophagus, stomach, and first part of your small intestine. The test uses a special type of x-ray called fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy shows internal organs moving in real time. The test also involves drinking a chalky-tasting liquid that contains barium. Barium is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray. Other names: esophagogram, esophagram, upper GI series, swallowing study1What is it used for? A barium swallow is used to help diagnose conditions that affect the throat, esophagus, stomach, and first part the small intestine. These include: Ulcers Hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of your stomach pushes into the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle between your stomach and chest. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), a condition in which contents of the stomach leak backward into the esophagus Structural problems in the GI tract, such as polyps (abnormal growths) and diverticula (pouches in the intestinal wall) Tumors1Why do I need a barium swallow? You may need this test if you have symptoms of an upper GI disorder. These include: Trouble swallowing Abdominal pain Vomiting Bloating1What happens during a barium swallow? A barium swallow is most often done by a radiologist or radiology technician. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using imaging tests to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. A barium swallow usually includes the following steps: You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown. You will be given a lead shield or apron to wear over your pelvic area. This protects the area from unnecessary radiation. You will stand, sit, or lie down on an x-ray table. You may be asked to change positions during the test. You will swallow a drink that contains barium. The drink is thick and chalky. It's usually flavored with chocolate or strawberry to make it easier to swallow. While you swallow, the radiologist will watch images of the barium traveling down your throat to your upper GI tract. You may be asked to hold your breath at certain times. The images will be recorded so they can be reviewed at a later time.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will probably be asked to fast (not eat or drink) after midnight on the night before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? You should not have this test if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to an unborn baby. For others, there is little risk to having this test. The dose of radiation is very low and not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.1What do the results mean? A normal result means that no abnormalities in size, shape, and movement were found in your throat, esophagus, stomach, or first part of the small intestine. If your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Hiatal hernia Ulcers Tumors Polyps Diverticula, a condition in which small sacs form in the inner wall of the intestine Esophageal stricture, a narrowing of the esophagus that can make it hard to swallow If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a barium swallow? Your results may also show signs of esophageal cancer. If your provider thinks you may have this type of cancer, he or she may do a procedure called an esophagoscopy. During an esophagoscopy, a thin, flexible tube is inserted through the mouth or nose and down into the esophagus. The tube has a video camera so a provider can view the area. The tube may also have a tool attached that can be used to remove tissue samples for testing (biopsy).1References ACR: American College of Radiology [Internet].

A basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a test that measures eight different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how the body uses food and energy. A BMP includes tests for the following: Glucose, a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy. Calcium, one of the body's most important minerals. Calcium is essential for proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart. Sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, and chloride. These are electrolytes, electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body. BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine, waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys. Abnormal levels of any of these substances or combination of them can be a sign of a serious health problem. Other names: chemistry panel, chemistry screen, chem 7, electrolyte panel1What is it used for? A BMP is used to check different body functions and processes, including: Kidney function Fluid and electrolyte balance Blood sugar levels Acid and base balance Metabolism1Why do I need a BMP? A BMP is often done as part of a regular checkup. You may also need this test if you: Are being treated in the emergency room Are being monitored for certain chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease1What happens during a BMP? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If any one result or combination of BMP results were not normal, it can indicate a number of different conditions. These include kidney disease, breathing problems, and complications related to diabetes. You will likely need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a BMP? There is a similar test to a BMP called a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). A CMP includes the same eight tests as a BMP, plus six more tests, which measure certain proteins and liver enzymes. The additional tests are: Albumin, a protein made in the liver Total protein, which measures the total amount of protein in the blood ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). These are different enzymes made by the liver. Bilirubin, a waste product made by the liver Your provider may order a CMP instead of a BMP to get a more complete picture of the health of your organs or to check for liver disease or other specific conditions.1References Bass Urgent Care [Internet].

A BCR-ABL genetic test looks for a genetic mutation (change) on a specific chromosome. Chromosomes are the parts of your cells that contain your genes. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color. People normally have 46 chromosomes, divided into 23 pairs, in each cell. One of each pair of chromosomes comes from your mother, and the other pair comes from your father. BCR-ABL is a mutation that is formed by the combination of two genes, known as BCR and ABL. It's sometimes called a fusion gene. The BCR gene is normally on chromosome number 22. The ABL gene is normally on chromosome number 9. The BCR-ABL mutation happens when pieces of BCR and ABL genes break off and switch places. The piece of chromosome 9 that breaks off includes part of the ABL gene. When this piece moves over to chromosome 22, part of the ABL gene attaches to the BCR gene. The merged gene is called the BCR-ABL fusion gene.  The changed chromosome 22, which contains the BCR-ABL gene, is called the Philadelphia chromosome because that's the city where researchers first discovered it. The BCR-ABL gene is not the type of mutation that is inherited from your parents. It is a type of somatic mutation, which means you are not born with it. You get it later in life. The BCR-ABL gene shows up in patients with certain types of leukemia, a cancer of the bone marrow and white blood cells. BCR-ABL is found in almost all patients with a type of leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Another name for CML is chronic myelogenous leukemia. Both names refer to the same disease. The BCR-ABL gene is also found in some patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and rarely in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Certain cancer medicines are especially effective in treating leukemia patients with the BCR-ABL gene mutation. These medicines also have fewer side effects than other cancer treatments. The same medicines are not effective in treating different types of leukemia or other cancers. Other names: BCR-ABL1, BCR-ABL1 fusion, Philadelphia chromosome1What is it used for? A BCR-ABL test is most often used to diagnose or rule out chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or a specific form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) called Ph-positive ALL. Ph-positive means a Philadelphia chromosome was found. The test is not used to diagnose other types of leukemia. The test may also be used to: See if cancer treatment is effective. See if a patient has developed a resistance to certain treatment. That means a treatment that used to be effective is no longer working.1Why do I need a BCR-ABL genetic test? You may need a BCR-ABL test if you have symptoms of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These include: Fatigue Fever Weight loss Night sweats (excessive sweating while sleeping) Joint or bone pain Some people with CML or Ph-positive ALL have no symptoms, or very mild symptoms, especially in the early stages of the disease. So your health care provider may order this test if a complete blood count or other blood test showed results that were not normal. You should also let your provider know if you have any symptoms that concern you. CML and Ph-positive ALL are easier to treat when found early. You may also need this test if you are currently being treated for CML or Ph-positive ALL. The test can help your provider see if your treatment is working.1What happens during a BCR-ABL genetic test? A BCR-ABL test is usually a blood test or a procedure called a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. If you are getting a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. If you are getting a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, your procedure may include the following steps: You'll lie down on your side or your stomach, depending on which bone will be used for testing. Most bone marrow tests are taken from the hip bone. Your body will be covered with cloth, so that only the area around the testing site is showing. The site will be cleaned with an antiseptic. You will get an injection of a numbing solution. It may sting. Once the area is numb, the health care provider will take the sample. You will need to lie very still during the tests.For a bone marrow aspiration, which is usually performed first, the health care provider will insert a needle through the bone and pull out bone marrow fluid and cells. You may feel a sharp but brief pain when the needle is inserted.For a bone marrow biopsy, the health care provider will use a special tool that twists into the bone to take out a sample of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure on the site while the sample is being taken. For a bone marrow aspiration, which is usually performed first, the health care provider will insert a needle through the bone and pull out bone marrow fluid and cells. You may feel a sharp but brief pain when the needle is inserted. For a bone marrow biopsy, the health care provider will use a special tool that twists into the bone to take out a sample of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure on the site while the sample is being taken. It takes about 10 minutes to perform both tests. After the test, the health care provider will cover the site with a bandage. Plan to have someone drive you home, since you may be given a sedative before the tests, which may make you drowsy.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for a blood or bone marrow test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After a bone marrow test, you may feel stiff or sore at the injection site. This usually goes away in a few days. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe a pain reliever to help.1What do the results mean? If your results show you have the BCR-ABL gene, as well as an abnormal amount of white blood cells, you will probably be diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). If you are currently being treated for CML or Ph-positive ALL, your results may show: The amount of BCR-ABL in your blood or bone marrow is increasing. This may mean your treatment is not working and/or you've become resistant to a certain treatment. The amount of BCR-ABL in your blood or bone marrow is decreasing. This may mean your treatment is working. The amount of BCR-ABL in your blood or bone marrow has not increased or decreased. This may mean your disease is stable. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a BCR-ABL genetic test? Treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been successful in patients with these forms of leukemia. It's important to see your health care provider regularly to make sure your treatments continue to work. If you become resistant to treatment, your provider may recommend other types of cancer therapy.1References American Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: American Cancer Society Inc.; c2018.

A beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test measures the amount of a protein called beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) in your body fluids. The test usually uses a sample of your blood. It may also be done using urine (pee) or in rare cases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). B2M is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances that are often made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body. B2M is found on most of the cells in your body. Normally, you have only small amounts of B2M in your blood and urine. High levels of B2M in body fluids are often caused by these blood and bone marrow cancers: Multiple myeloma Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Certain types of lymphoma A beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test can't diagnose cancer or any other condition. That's because there are so many conditions that can cause high levels of B2M. But if you've already been diagnosed with one of these blood and bone marrow cancers, a B2M test can provide important information about your cancer including: How much cancer you have in your body and how fast it's growing How your cancer may behave in the future  How much your treatment is helping This information can help you and your health care provider plan your care. Other names: total beta-2 microglobulin, β2-microglobulin, B2M, B2MG, thymotaxin1What is it used for? A beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test is most often used if you have been diagnosed with certain cancers of the bone marrow or blood. Testing your B2M levels can help: Find out how much cancer is in your body Predict how your cancer will develop Pick your treatment and check whether it's working Check whether cancer has spread to your brain and/or spinal cord (This is done only if you have symptoms.)1Why do I need a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test? If you have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or certain types of lymphoma, you may need a B2M test to find out how serious your disease is. B2M testing can help monitor your cancer and check whether your treatment is working. If you have multiple myeloma, you may need a B2M test to see whether your cancer is spreading. A test of a urine sample may also be needed to check whether your disease is affecting your kidneys.1What happens during a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test? A beta-2 microglobulin test usually uses a sample of your blood. In certain cases, you may need to provide a 24-hour urine sample, which means collecting all your urine for a full day. If your provider suspects that cancer has spread to your brain or spine, you may have a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a 24-hour urine sample, you will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate (pee) in the toilet as usual.  Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in the refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed. For a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap (also known as a lumbar puncture). A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. A provider numbs your skin with medicine and uses a thin, hollow needle to remove some fluid from between the bones in your lower spine. You usually go home the same day.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? For blood and urine tests, there are no special preparations. For a CSF analysis (spinal tap), you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? With a blood test, there is very little risk. After the test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. With a urine test, there is no known risk. With a CSF analysis, there is very little risk from a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back or have some bleeding where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more. Your provider may suggest treatment to relieve the pain.1What do the results mean? If your B2M levels were measured to learn about your cancer: The higher your B2M levels, the more cancer you have in your body. Higher levels are linked to cancers that tend to grow faster./li>
 If you have multiple myeloma, higher levels of B2M are linked with kidney problems. If your B2M levels were measured to check how well your treatment is working, your provider may look at several test results over time to look for a trend: Increasing B2M levels may mean your treatment is not working. Decreasing B2M levels may mean your treatment is working. B2M levels that don't change may mean that your disease is stable and hasn't gotten better or worse. If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test? B2M levels may be higher than normal in many conditions that aren't cancer. The amount of B2M in body fluids may be measured in conditions such as: Kidney disease HIV/AIDS Multiple sclerosis1References Allina Health [Internet].

A bilirubin blood test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance made during your body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. Bilirubin is found in bile, a fluid your liver makes that helps you digest food. If your liver is healthy, it will remove most of the bilirubin from your body. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out of your liver and into your blood. When too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream, it can cause jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow. Signs of jaundice, along with a bilirubin blood test, can help your health care provider find out if you have liver disease. Other names: Total serum bilirubin, TSB1What is it used for? A bilirubin blood test is used to check the health of your liver. The test is also commonly used to help diagnose newborn jaundice. Many healthy babies get jaundice because their livers aren't developed enough to get rid of enough bilirubin. Newborn jaundice is usually not harmful and clears up within a few weeks. But in some cases, high bilirubin levels can lead to brain damage, so infants are often tested as a precaution.1Why do I need a bilirubin blood test? Your provider may order a bilirubin blood test: If you have symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, or stomach pain. These could be symptoms of hepatitis, cirrhosis, or other liver diseases. They may also be signs of gallbladder disease. To find out if there is a blockage in the bile ducts, the tubes that carry bile from your liver. To check on an existing liver disease or disorder. To diagnose disorders related to problems with breaking down red blood cells. High bilirubin levels in the bloodstream may be a sign of a condition called hemolytic anemia. In this condition, the body destroys red blood cells faster than it makes them.1What happens during a bilirubin blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your health care provider may tell you to fast (not eat or drink)  for four hours before your blood test. If there are any other special instructions, your provider will let you know.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Normal results can vary, but high bilirubin levels may mean your liver isn't working right. However, abnormal results don't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Other things may cause higher than normal bilirubin levels, such as certain medicines and foods or strenuous exercise. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a bilirubin blood test? A bilirubin blood test is only one measure of your liver health. If your provider thinks you might have a liver disease or a red blood cell disorder, you may need other tests. These tests may include: Liver function tests, a group of tests that measure different substances in your blood. Liver protein tests Urine tests An ultrasound A liver biopsy to get a sample of your liver tissue to examine under a microscope.1References American Liver Foundation. [Internet].

A bilirubin in urine test measures the levels of bilirubin in your urine. Normally, urine doesn't have any bilirubin. If there is bilirubin n your urine, it may be an early sign of a liver condition. Bilirubin is a yellow substance that your body makes during the normal process of breaking down red blood cells. Your liver uses bilirubin to make bile, a fluid that helps you digest food. A healthy liver removes most of the bilirubin from your body. But if there is a problem with your liver, bilirubin can build up in your blood and get into your urine. Other names: urine test, urine analysis, UA, chemical urinalysis, direct bilirubin1What is it used for? A bilirubin in urine test is often part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and other substances in your urine (pee). Urinalysis is often used to check your general health. It can also help diagnose liver problems and many other medical conditions.1Why do I need a bilirubin in urine test? Your health care provider may have ordered a bilirubin in urine test as part of your regular checkup. The test may also be ordered if you have symptoms of a liver condition, gallbladder disease, or a problem with your bile ducts (the small tubes that carry bile out of your liver). These symptoms may include: Nausea and vomiting Lack of appetite Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly) Swelling in your ankles and legs Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop) Frequent itching Bilirubin in urine can be an early sign of liver damage. It may even show up before you have symptoms. So, your provider may order a bilirubin in urine test if you have a high risk for liver damage or disease  because of: A family history of liver disease Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Obesity Diabetes Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis1What happens during a bilirubin in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?subtitle You don't need any special preparations to test for bilirubin in urine. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a bilirubin in urine test.1What do the results mean? If bilirubin is found in your urine, it may be a sign that you have: A liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis A blockage in your bile ducts, the small tubes that carry bile out of your liver Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I should know about a bilirubin in urine test? A bilirubin in urine test is only one measure of your liver health. If your test results aren't normal, your provider may order other tests, including a liver panel. A liver panel is a group of blood tests that measures many different enzymes, proteins, and other substances in the liver. It is often used to help find and diagnose liver disease. Some at-home urine tests, that you buy without a prescription, may measure bilirubin in urine. These tests usually involve dipping a test strip in a cup of urine or placing a few drops of urine on the strip. If you do an at-home bilirubin in urine test, talk with your provider about your results.1References American Liver Foundation. [Internet]. New York: American Liver Foundation; c2017.

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid=bilirubin_direct Blood Alcohol Level : 1What is a blood alcohol test? A blood alcohol test measures the amount of alcohol in a sample of your blood. You will have alcohol in your blood if you've been drinking alcoholic beverages. Alcohol is also called ethanol. It's the main ingredient of alcoholic drinks, such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits (liquor). When you have an alcoholic drink, the alcohol is quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. Your liver breaks down the alcohol so your body can get rid of it. If you drink faster than your liver can break down alcohol, the alcohol level in your blood will increase and you may start to feel intoxicated (drunk). Alcohol intoxication affects how your brain works. At first, you may feel more relaxed, or talkative than usual. As alcohol levels increase, you may have some problems thinking clearly. You make have difficulty with your balance, slurred speech, slowed reaction time, and loss of judgement. Continuing to drink after you are intoxicated can lead to an alcohol overdose. Symptoms include vomiting, trouble breathing, and passing out. An alcohol overdose can lead to coma or death. There are a few blood tests that can measure whether a person has been drinking. A blood alcohol concentration (BAC) test is commonly used to see if a person has been drinking recently. It is also called a blood alcohol content test. This test can find alcohol in your blood for up to 12 hours after drinking. It can also show the amount of alcohol that you drank. Other blood tests measure substances that may stay in your blood for weeks after you've had alcohol. These tests are typically used to test for alcohol use disorder (AUD) or to check whether a person recovering from AUD has stayed sober. Other names: blood alcohol level test, ethanol test, ethyl alcohol, blood alcohol content1What is it used for? A blood alcohol test may be used for many purposes, including: Legal evidence. Alcohol testing may be part of:

A check to see if you've been "driving while drunk." This means that your alcohol level is above the legal limit. To get quick results, police often ask you to breathe into a breathalyzer, a device that checks your breath for alcohol. But another option may be to go to a medical facility to get a blood test, which provides more accurate results than a breathalyzer.
A check for under-age drinking
An investigation into a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation
A court case or as part of a parole agreement

But another option may be to go to a medical facility to get a blood test, which provides more accurate results than a breathalyzer. A check for under-age drinking An investigation into a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation A court case or as part of a parole agreement Employment. Employers test for alcohol use before hiring you. After you're hired, they may test you to check for on-the-job drinking. If you have a work accident, you may be tested to see whether alcohol was involved. Testing for alcohol poisoning. Hospital emergency staff may use a blood alcohol test to check for this life-threatening condition that can happen if blood alcohol level gets very high after drinking large amounts of alcohol. Young children can also get alcohol poisoning from drinking household products that contain alcohol, such as mouthwash and certain cold medicines. Monitoring treatment for alcohol use disorder. Some programs may require testing to see if you have been able to avoid drinking.1Why do I need a blood alcohol test? You may need a blood alcohol test if you are suspected of drunk driving and/or have symptoms of intoxication. These include: Difficulty with balance and coordination Slurred speech Slowed reflexes Nausea and vomiting Mood changes Poor judgment You or your child may also need this test if there are symptoms of alcohol poisoning. In addition to the above symptoms, alcohol poisoning can cause: Confusion Irregular breathing Seizures Low body temperature1What happens during a blood alcohol test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This process usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a blood alcohol test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Blood alcohol level results may be given in different ways, including percentage of blood alcohol content (BAC). Typical results are below. Sober: 0.0 percent BAC Legally intoxicated: .08 percent BAC Very impaired: .08–0.40 percent BAC. At this blood alcohol level, you may have difficulty walking and speaking. Other symptoms may include confusion, nausea, and drowsiness. At risk for serious complications: Above .40 percent BAC. At this blood alcohol level, you may be at risk for coma or death. The timing of this test can affect the accuracy of the results. A blood alcohol test is only accurate within 6–12 hours after your last drink. If you have questions or concerns about your results, you may want to talk to a health care provider and/or a lawyer.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw3564 Blood Differential : 1What is a Blood Differential Test? A blood differential test measures the amount of each type of white blood cell (WBC) that you have in your body. White blood cells (leukocytes) are part of your immune system, a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect you from infection. There are five different types of white blood cells: Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell. They are your body's main defense against infection when bacteria, viruses, or other germs enter your body. Lymphocytes include two main types of white blood cells: B cells and T cells. B cells fight off invading viruses, bacteria, or toxins. Certain T cells can target and destroy your body's own cells, such as cancer cells and cells that have been infected by viruses. Monocytes kill bacteria, viruses, and other germs that may make you sick. They also boost your body's immune response and clear away dead cells. Eosinophils defend against parasites and infections. They are also involved in allergies and help control inflammation (swelling and redness). Basophils release enzymes during allergic reactions and asthma attacks. However, your test results may have more than five numbers. For example, the lab may list the results as counts as well as percentages. Other names for a blood differential test: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, Differential, White blood cell differential count, Leukocyte differential count1What is it used for? A blood differential test is often part of a general physical exam. Because the five types of white blood cell do different jobs, measuring them separately can give your health care provider important information about your health. The test can also help diagnose a variety of medical conditions, such as: Infections Autoimmune diseases Inflammatory diseases Leukemia and other types of cancer1Why do I need a blood differential test? A blood differential test is used for many reasons. Your provider may have ordered the test to: Monitor your overall health or as part of a routine checkup. Diagnose a medical condition when you have symptoms. For example, if you are feeling unusually tired or weak, or have unexplained bruising or other symptoms, this test may help uncover the cause. Keep track of an existing blood disorder or related condition.1What happens during a blood differential test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? No special preparation is necessary.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. After the test, some people experience mild pain, dizziness, or bruising. These symptoms usually go away quickly.1What do the results mean? There are many reasons your blood differential test results may be higher or lower than normal. For example, a high white blood cell count may mean you have an infection, an immune disorder, leukemia, or an allergic reaction. A low count may be caused by bone marrow problems, reactions to medicines, or cancer. But abnormal results don't always mean you have a condition that needs medical treatment. Factors such as exercise, diet, alcohol level, medicines, and even a woman's menstrual period can affect the results. If your results seem abnormal, your provider may order more specific tests to help figure out the cause. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a blood differential test? Use of certain steroids may increase your white blood cell count, which can lead to an abnormal result in your blood differential test.1References Busti A.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK261/#A4533 Blood Glucose Test : 1What is a Blood Glucose Test? A blood glucose test measures the glucose levels in your blood. Glucose is a type of sugar. It is your body's main source of energy. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells. Too much or too little glucose in the blood can be a sign of a serious medical condition. High blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) may be a sign of diabetes, a disorder that can cause serious, long-term health conditions. High blood sugar may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood, such as problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands. Low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) are common among people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. Certain conditions, such as liver disease, may cause low levels of blood glucose in people without diabetes, but this is uncommon. Without treatment, severe low blood sugar can lead to major health problems, including seizures and brain damage. Other names: blood sugar, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting blood glucose (FBG), random blood sugar, glucose challenge test, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)1What is it used for? A blood glucose test is used to find out if your blood sugar levels are in a healthy range. It is often used to help diagnose and monitor diabetes.1Why do I need a blood glucose test? Your health care provider may order a blood glucose test if you have symptoms of high glucose levels or low glucose levels. Symptoms of high blood glucose levels include: Increased thirst and urination (peeing) Blurred vision Fatigue Sores that don't heal Weight loss when you're not trying to lose weight Numbness or tingling in your feet or hands Symptoms of low blood glucose levels include: Feeling shaky or jittery Hunger Fatigue Feeling dizzy, confused, or irritable Headache A fast heartbeat or arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Having trouble seeing or speaking clearly Fainting or seizures You may also need a blood glucose test if you have a high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. You're more likely to develop diabetes if you: Are overweight or have obesity Are age 45 or older Have a family history of diabetes Have high blood pressure Don't exercise enough Have a history of heart disease or stroke Have had gestational diabetes (diabetes that happens only during pregnancy) If you are pregnant, you will likely get a blood glucose test between the 24th and 28th week of your pregnancy to check for gestational diabetes.1What happens during a blood glucose test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. For some types of glucose blood tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken: A glucose challenge test is used to test for gestational diabetes in pregnancy. If your blood glucose level is higher than normal, you may have gestational diabetes. You'll need an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to get a diagnosis. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is used to diagnose gestational diabetes, and type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in people who aren't pregnant. A blood sample will be taken before you have a sugary drink and then again, every hour for the next 2 or 3 hours.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If your provider orders a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test, you will need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least eight hours before the test. Other blood glucose tests don't require any special preparations. Ask your provider whether you need to fast before your glucose test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After an oral glucose tolerance test, you may feel light-headed. Your provider may suggest that you plan to have someone take you home.1What do the results mean? If your results show higher than normal glucose levels, it may mean you have or are at risk for getting diabetes. High glucose levels may also be a sign of: Hyperthyroidism Pancreas disorders Stress from surgery, very serious illness, or trauma If you have diabetes, lower than normal glucose levels may be caused by: Side effects from certain diabetes medicines Not eating enough, especially after taking diabetes medicine Being more physically active than usual If you don't have diabetes, low blood glucose levels may be a sign of: Liver disease Kidney disease Underactive adrenal, pituitary, or thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) Alcohol use disorder (AUD) If your glucose results are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines and stress can affect glucose levels. To learn what your test results mean, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I should know about a blood glucose test? If you have diabetes, you may need to do blood sugar testing at home every day to help manage your blood glucose levels. There are two ways to do this: Blood glucose meters require you to prick your finger with a small device called a lancet. You apply a drop of blood to a test strip and insert it into a small, electronic glucose meter, which measures the glucose is in your blood. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) use a tiny sensor that you insert under your skin. Every few minutes, the sensor measures glucose levels in fluids between your cells. If your glucose is too high or too low, you use a blood glucose meter to check your blood levels before making changes to raise or lower your glucose level.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet].

A test called a urinalysis checks a sample of your urine (pee) to see if there's blood in it. In some cases, you can see blood in your urine. It may make your urine red or reddish brown. But you can have small amounts of blood in your urine that you can't see. A urinalysis can find a small amount of blood cells in your urine as well as other types of cells, chemicals, and substances. Having blood in your urine usually isn't serious. But in some cases, red or white blood cells in your urine may mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI),  kidney disease, or liver disease. Other names: microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine, urine test, urine analysis, UA, urine microscopy1What is it used for? A urinalysis, which includes a test for blood in urine, is used to check your general health, including the health of your urinary tract, kidneys, and liver. The test can also be used to check for other health problems besides blood in urine.1Why do I need a blood in urine test? Your health care provider may order a urinalysis as part of a routine exam. You may also need this test if you have seen blood in your urine or have other symptoms that could be caused by a problem with your kidneys or urinary tract. These symptoms include: Painful urination Frequent urination Back pain Abdominal (belly) pain1What happens during a blood in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test. Outside blood could get into your urine sample and affect your test results.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations before getting a test for blood in your urine. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a blood in urine test.1What do the results mean? Many things can cause blood in urine. Most of them aren't serious. The blood may be caused by taking certain medicines, intense exercise, sexual activity, or menstruation (having a period). But blood in your urine may be a sign of a more serious problem, such as: Infection in the bladder, kidney, or prostate Bladder or kidney stones Kidney injury from an accident or sports A viral infection, including hepatitis (a disease of the liver causing inflammation) Cancer of the bladder, kidney, or prostate Enlarged prostate (BPH) Inflammation of the kidney, urethra, or bladder A blood disorder Polycystic kidney disease Disorders of the ureters (tubes that connect your kidneys to your bladder) If your test result shows blood in your urine, you may need more tests to find out why. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a blood in urine test? A blood in urine test is usually part of a routine urinalysis. A urinalysis also measures other substances in the urine, including proteins, acid and sugar levels, cell fragments, and crystals.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

A blood smear is a sample of blood that's spread on a glass slide which is treated with a special stain. In the past, all blood smears were examined under a microscope by laboratory professionals. Now automated digital systems may be used to help examine blood smears. The purpose of examining a blood smear is to check the size, shape, and number of three types of blood cells: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body White blood cells, which fight infection Platelets, which help your blood to clot Other names: peripheral smear, peripheral blood film, smear, blood film, manual differential, differential slide, blood cell morphology, blood smear analysis1What is it used for? A blood smear is used to help diagnose and monitor many conditions, such as blood disorders, sudden kidney failure, and treatment for certain cancers.1Why do I need a blood smear? You may need a blood smear if you have abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a routine test that measures many different parts of your blood. Your health care provider may order a blood smear if you have symptoms of a blood disorder, such as: Fatigue Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Unusual bleeding, including nosebleeds Fever that lasts, or comes and goes Bone pain Anemia Easy bruising A spleen that's larger than normal1What happens during a blood smear? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparation for a blood smear. If your provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The results of a blood smear alone usually can't diagnose a medical condition. Your provider will use your results combined with your medical history, symptoms, and other test results to make a diagnosis. Your blood smear results usually describe the appearance and number of your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Your results will describe anything unusual about your blood. Red blood cell results that aren't normal, it may be a sign of: Anemia Sickle cell anemia Hemolytic anemia, a type of anemia in which the body destroys red blood cells faster than they are replaced Thalassemia Bone marrow disorders Liver disease Cancer that has spread to the bone White blood cell results that aren't normal may be a sign of: Infection or inflammation Allergies Leukemia Bone marrow disorders Platelet results that aren't normal may be a sign of: Thrombocytopenia, a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough platelets, which increases the risk of bleeding Inherited platelet disorders (uncommon), such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome If you have been very ill or stressed, or you have had a blood transfusion, the shape and number of your blood cells may be different than usual.  So, a blood smear may not provide enough information for your provider to make a diagnosis. If any of your blood smear results are not normal, your provider will likely order more tests. Talk with your provider to learn more about your results. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a blood smear? A blood smear may be used to help find certain types of parasites in your blood which cause diseases, such as: Malaria, spread by bites from infected mosquitos Babesiosis, spread mainly by bites from infected ticks Chagas disease, spread mainly by bites from "kissing bugs" (triatomine) Your provider may order the test if you live in or travel to areas where you might have been infected, and you have symptoms. Symptoms depend on the type of parasite. Common symptoms may include fever, fatigue, body aches, rash, and problems with digestion.1References Almomani MH, Mangla A. Bernard Soulier Syndrome.

A bone density scan, also known as a DEXA scan, is a type of low-dose x-ray test that measures calcium and other minerals in your bones. The measurement helps show the strength and thickness (known as bone density or mass) of your bones. Most people's bones become thinner as they get older. When bones become thinner than normal, it's known as osteopenia. Osteopenia puts you at risk for a more serious condition called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a progressive disease that causes bones to become very thin and brittle. Osteoporosis usually affects older people and is most common in women over the age of 65. People with osteoporosis are at higher risk for fractures (broken bones), especially in their hips, spine, and wrists. Other names: bone mineral density test, BMD test, DEXA scan, DXA; Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry1What is it used for? A bone density scan is used to: Diagnose osteopenia (low bone mass) Diagnose osteoporosis Predict risk of future fractures See if treatment for osteoporosis is working1Why do I need a bone density scan? Most women age 65 or older should have a bone density scan. Women in this age group are at high risk for losing bone density, which can lead to fractures. You may also be at risk for low bone density if you: Have a very low body weight Have had one or more fractures after the age of 50 Have lost a half inch or more in height within one year Are a man over the age of 70 Have a family history of osteoporosis Other risk factors include: Lack of physical activity Smoking cigarettes Heavy drinking Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet1What happens during a bone density scan? There are different ways to measure bone density. The most common and accurate way uses a procedure called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, also known as a DEXA scan. The scan is usually done in a radiologist's office. During a DEXA scan: You will lie on your back on a padded table. You will probably be able to leave your clothes on. You may need to lie with your legs straight, or you may be asked to rest your legs on a padded platform. A scanning machine will pass over your lower spine and hip. At the same time, another scanning machine called a photon generator will pass beneath you. The images from the two machines will be combined and sent to a computer. A health care provider will view the images on the computer screen. While the machines are scanning, you will need to stay very still. You may be asked to hold your breath. To measure bone density in the forearm, finger, hand, or foot, a provider may use a portable scanner known as a peripheral DEXA (p-DEXA) scan.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may be told to stop taking calcium supplements 24 to 48 hours before your test. Also, you should avoid wearing metal jewelry or clothes with metal parts, such as buttons or buckles.1Are there any risks to the test? A bone density scan uses very low doses of radiation. It is safe for most people. But it is not recommended for pregnant woman. Even low doses of radiation could harm an unborn baby. Be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.1What do the results mean? Bone density results are often given in the form of a T score. A T score is a measurement that compares your bone density measurement with the bone density of a healthy 30-year-old. A low T score means you probably have some bone loss. Your results may show one of the following: A T score of -1.0 or higher. This is considered normal bone density. A T score between -1.0 and -2.5. This means you have low bone density (osteopenia) and may be at risk for developing osteoporosis. A T score of -2.5 or less. This means you probably have osteoporosis. If your results show you have low bone density, your health care provider will recommend steps to prevent further bone loss. These may include: Getting more exercise, with activities such walking, dancing, and using weight machines. Adding calcium and vitamin D to your diet Taking prescription medicines to increase bone density If you have questions about your results and/or treatments for bone loss, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a bone density scan? A DEXA scan is the most common way to measure bone density. But your health care provider may order more tests to confirm a diagnosis or to find out if bone loss treatment is working. These include a calcium blood test, a vitamin D test, and/or tests for certain hormones.1References Kaiser Permanente [Internet]. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc; c2021.

Bone marrow is a soft, spongy tissue found in the center of most bones. Bone marrow makes different types of blood cells, including: Red blood cells (also called erythrocytes), which carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body White blood cells (also called leukocytes), which help you fight infections Platelets, which help with blood clotting Bone marrow tests check to see if your bone marrow is working correctly and making normal amounts of blood cells. The tests can help diagnose and monitor bone marrow disorders, blood disorders, and certain types of cancer. There are two types of procedures used to collect bone marrow samples for testing: Bone marrow aspiration removes a small amount of bone marrow fluid and cells Bone marrow biopsy removes a small piece of bone and bone marrow Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy are usually done at the same time. Other names: bone marrow examination1What are they used for?  Bone marrow tests are used to: Find out the cause of problems with red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets Diagnose and monitor blood disorders, such as:

Anemia (when the cause is unknown)
Polycythemia vera
Thrombocytopenia

 Anemia (when the cause is unknown) Polycythemia vera Thrombocytopenia Diagnose bone marrow disorders Diagnose and monitor treatment for certain types of cancers, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma Diagnose the cause of an unexplained fever, which could be from an infection in the  bone marrow1Why do I need a bone marrow test? Your health care provider may order a bone marrow aspiration and a bone marrow biopsy if other blood tests show your levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are not normal. Too many or too few blood cells may mean you have a medical condition, such as cancer that starts in your blood or bone marrow. If you are being treated for another type of cancer, these tests can find out if the cancer has spread to your bone marrow. Bone marrow tests may also be used to see how well cancer treatment is working.1What happens during a bone marrow test? Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy procedures are usually done at the same time. A health care provider will collect the marrow samples for testing. Usually, the samples can be collected in about ten minutes. Before the procedure, you may be asked to put on a hospital gown. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be checked. You may choose to have a mild sedative, which is medicine to help you relax. You may also have the choice to use stronger medicine that will make you sleep. Your provider can help you decide which option is best for you. During the procedure: You'll lie down on your side or your stomach, depending on which bone will be used to get the samples. Most bone marrow samples are taken from the back of the hip bone, called the iliac crest. But other bones may be used. An area of skin over the bone will be cleaned with an antiseptic. You will get an injection (shot) of medicine to numb the skin and the bone underneath. It may sting. When the area is numb, the provider will make a very small incision (cut) in your skin and insert a hollow needle. You will need to lie very still during the procedure:

The bone marrow aspiration is usually done first. The provider will push the needle into the bone and use a syringe attached to the needle to pull out bone marrow fluid and cells. You may feel a brief, sharp pain. The aspiration takes only a few minutes.
The bone marrow biopsy uses a special hollow biopsy needle inserted through the same skin opening. The provider will twist the needle into the bone to take out a small piece, or core, of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure or brief pain while the sample is being taken.

 The bone marrow aspiration is usually done first. The provider will push the needle into the bone and use a syringe attached to the needle to pull out bone marrow fluid and cells. You may feel a brief, sharp pain. The aspiration takes only a few minutes. The bone marrow biopsy uses a special hollow biopsy needle inserted through the same skin opening. The provider will twist the needle into the bone to take out a small piece, or core, of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure or brief pain while the sample is being taken. After the test, the health care provider will cover your skin with a bandage. If you didn't use medicine to relax or sleep, you'll usually need to stay lying down for about 15 minutes to make sure that the bleeding has stopped. Afterwards, you can do your usual activities as soon as you are able. If you used medicine to relax or sleep, you'll need to stay longer before you can go home. You may also need to rest the next day.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your provider will tell you whether you need to fast (not eat or drink) for a few hours before the procedure. Plan to have someone take you home after the test, because you may be drowsy if you are given medicine to help you relax or sleep during the procedure. You'll receive instructions for how to prepare, but be sure to ask your provider any questions you have about the procedure.1Are there any risks to the test? After a bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy you may feel stiff or sore where the sample was taken. This usually goes away in a few days. Your provider may recommend or prescribe a pain reliever to help. Don't take any pain medicine your provider hasn't approved. Certain pain relievers, such as aspirin, could increase your risk of bleeding. Serious symptoms are very rare, but may include: Increased pain or discomfort where the sample was taken Redness, swelling, bleeding, or other fluids leaking from at the site Fever If you have any of these symptoms, call your provider.1What do the results mean? It may take several days or even weeks to get your bone marrow test results. Your provider may have ordered many different types of tests on your marrow sample, so the results often include a lot of complex information. Your provider can explain what your results mean. In certain cases, if your test results are not normal, you may need to have more tests to confirm a diagnosis or to decide which treatment would be best. If you have cancer that affects your bones and marrow, your test results may provide information about your cancer stage, which is how much cancer you have in your body and how fast it may be growing. If you are already being treated for cancer, your test results may show: How well your treatment is working Whether your treatment is affecting your bone marrow Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father. The BRAF gene makes a protein that helps control cell growth. It's known as an oncogene. An oncogene works like a gas pedal on a car. Normally, an oncogene turns on cell growth as needed. But if you have a BRAF mutation, it's like the gas pedal is stuck down, and the gene can't stop cells from growing. Uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer. A BRAF mutation can be inherited from your parents or acquired later in life. Mutations that happen later in life are usually caused by the environment or from a mistake that happens in your body during cell division. Inherited BRAF mutations are very rare, but they can cause serious health problems. Acquired (also known as somatic) BRAF mutations are much more common. These mutations have been found in about half of all cases of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. BRAF mutations are also often found in other disorders and different types of cancer, including cancers of the colon, thyroid, and ovaries. Cancers with a BRAF mutation tend to be more serious than those without the mutation. Other names: BRAF gene mutation analysis, Melanoma, BRAF V600 mutation, cobas1What is it used for? The test is most often used to look for a BRAF mutation in patients with melanoma or other BRAF-related cancers. Certain cancer medicines are especially effective in people who have a BRAF mutation. The same medicines are not as effective and sometimes dangerous to people who don't have the mutation. BRAF testing may also be used to see if you are at risk for cancer based on family history and/or your own health history.1Why do I need a BRAF genetic test? You may need BRAF testing if you've been diagnosed with melanoma or another type of cancer. Knowing whether you have the mutation can help your provider prescribe the right treatment. You may also need this test to see if you are at higher risk for getting cancer. Risk factors include a family history of cancer and/or having cancer at an early age. The specific age depends on the type of cancer.1What happens during a BRAF genetic test? Most BRAF tests are done in a procedure called a tumor biopsy. During a biopsy, a health care provider will take out a small piece of tissue by cutting or scraping the surface of a tumor. If your provider needs to test tumor tissue from inside your body, he or she may use a special needle to withdraw the sample.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for a BRAF test.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have a little discomfort at the site for a day or two.1What do the results mean? If you have melanoma or other type of cancer, and the results show you have a BRAF mutation, your provider can prescribe medicines that are designed to target the mutation. These medicines can be more effective than other treatments. If you have melanoma or other type of cancer, and the results show you don't have a mutation, your provider will prescribe different types of medicines to treat your cancer. If you have not been diagnosed with cancer and your results show you have a BRAF genetic mutation, it does not mean you have cancer, but you have a higher risk of cancer. But more frequent cancer screenings, such as a skin exam, can reduce your risk. During a skin exam, a health care provider will carefully look over the skin on your whole body to check for moles and other suspicious growths. Talk to your provider about other steps you can take to reduce your risk. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a BRAF test? You may hear your provider talk about a V600E mutation. There are different types of BRAF mutations. V600E is the most common type of BRAF mutation.1References American Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: American Cancer Society Inc.; c2018.

A BRCA gene test uses a sample of your blood, saliva (spit), or cells from inside of your cheek to look for changes in your BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that may increase your risk of cancer. Changes in your genes are called gene variants or mutations. Not all gene variants are harmful. Genes are parts of DNA that you inherit from your parents. They carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. BRCA genes repair damaged DNA in your cells and protect you from getting certain types of cancer. If you have a harmful variant in your BRCA genes, they may not work properly. This increases your risk of getting cancer. The most common cancers linked to harmful BRCA variants are: Breast cancer. BRCA is short for breast cancer gene. The increased risk for breast cancer mostly affects females. But the breast cancer risk for males who have a harmful BRCA variant is higher than for other males. Ovarian cancer. This is cancer of the female reproductive glands where eggs form. Prostate cancer. This is cancer of the male reproductive gland that makes fluid for semen. Pancreatic cancer. This is cancer of the pancreas, an organ that helps you digest food and makes important hormones. Not everyone who has a harmful variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 will get cancer. And if you find out you have a harmful variant, you may be able to take steps to lower your risk and protect your health. Other names: BRCA gene test, BRCA gene 1, BRCA gene 2, breast cancer susceptibility gene1, breast cancer susceptibility gene 21What is it used for? This test is used to find out if you have harmful changes in your BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes that  increase your risk of getting certain cancers, especially breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer.1Why do I need a BRCA gene test? Harmful BRCA gene variants are rare. They affect only about 0.2 percent of the U.S. population. So, BRCA testing is not recommended for most people. You and your family members are more likely to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant if either side of your family has a strong history of breast or ovarian cancer. If you're concerned that you may have a harmful variant in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, your health care provider or a genetic counselor can review your personal and family health history to see if you need this test. In general, it's important to talk with a provider about BRCA testing if your personal or family health history includes: Breast cancer, especially:

Before age 50
In both breasts
In a male
Triple negative breast cancer which has limited treatment options, including chemotherapy and/or surgery

 Before age 50 In both breasts In a male Triple negative breast cancer which has limited treatment options, including chemotherapy and/or surgery Cancer of the ovaries, fallopian tubes (tubes connecting the ovaries to the uterus), or peritoneum (tissue that covers your belly organs). Prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body (metastatic cancer). Pancreatic cancer. Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry. BRCA variants are much more common in this group compared with the general population. They are also more common in people from other parts of Europe, including Iceland, Norway, and Denmark. A relative already diagnosed with a harmful gene variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2. When you think about your family health history, consider all breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers on both sides of your family. And consider the health of your grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, siblings, half-siblings, nieces and nephews, and grandchildren.1What happens during a BRCA gene test? A BRCA test can use either a sample of your blood, saliva, or a cheek swab. For a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a saliva test: You'll spit into a container or use a cotton pad to soak up some saliva. For a cheek swab: A health care professional will wipe the inside of your cheek with a small tool to remove some cells. You may have the option of doing it yourself. An at-home test kit is available to buy without a prescription. It allows you to collect a saliva sample to send to a lab for testing. The test checks for the three most common harmful variants in BRCA genes. But there are more than 1000 known variants. So, a home test can't rule out the possibility that you have a variant. Ask your provider whether an at-home test is right for you.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? For a blood test: You don't need any special preparations. For a saliva test: A half hour before the test, you may need to stop eating, drinking, or smoking. Follow all the instructions your provider gives you or the instructions in an at-home kit. For a cheek swab: You may be asked to rinse your mouth before the test. With any type of genetic test, you may want to meet with a genetic counselor first to see if testing is right for you. Your counselor can explain the pros and cons of learning more about your cancer risk. After your test, a counselor can help with the medical and emotional impact that your results may have on you and your family.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no risks linked to providing a saliva sample or having a cheek swab.1What do the results mean? Your provider or genetic counselor will need to explain how your results affect your risk for certain cancers. That's because the meaning of your test results depends on the exact type of variant you have and your personal and family health history. In general, your results may be reported using these terms: A negative (normal) result means that the test didn't find any harmful changes in your BRCA genes. How this affects your cancer risk depends on whether you've already had cancer and whether a member of your family has a harmful BRCA variant. An uncertain result may also be called a "variant of uncertain significance (VUS)". It means that a variant in your BRCA genes was found, but researchers don't know whether that variant causes cancer. A positive result may also be called a "likely pathogenic variant." It means that you have a harmful gene variant that is known to increase the risk of certain cancers. But the test cannot tell whether you will develop cancer. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a BRCA gene test? If your results show that you have a harmful variant in your BRCA genes, talk with your provider about ways to lower your cancer risk. You may discuss: Your schedule for cancer screening tests. Should you get tested for cancer sooner and more often than usual? These are important questions for all adults who have a harmful BRCA variant. Taking certain medicines and/or having surgery to reduce the risk of cancer. Surgery may include removing both breasts and/or the ovaries and fallopian tubes.1References American Society of Clinical Oncology [Internet]. American Society of Clinical Oncology; 2005-2022.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/tu6462 Breast Biopsy : 1What is a breast biopsy? A breast biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample of breast tissue so that it can be checked for signs of disease. A doctor called a pathologist looks at the tissue under a microscope to diagnose breast cancer and other breast diseases. Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the milk ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and the lobules (the small lobes of breast tissue that make milk). Breast cancer is much more common in women, but men can get it, too. Not much is known about breast cancer risk in transgender people. If you are transgender, talk with your provider about your risk. There are different ways to do a breast biopsy.  Some methods remove breast tissue with a needle and others use a small incision (cut) in your skin to remove part or all of the suspicious tissue. Most people who need a breast biopsy don't have cancer. Other names: core needle biopsy; core biopsy, breast; fine-needle aspiration; open surgery biopsy1What is it used for? A breast biopsy is the only way to find out whether a suspicious change in your breast is cancer. You may have a biopsy after other breast tests, such as a physical breast exam or a mammogram, show signs that could be breast cancer.1Why do I need a breast biopsy? You may need a breast biopsy if: You or your health care provider felt a lump, thickening, or other change in your breast. A mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI test shows a lump, calcium deposits, or other signs that might mean cancer. The skin on your breast or nipple is red, scaly, or swollen, or your nipple is pulled inward. You have a discharge of abnormal fluid coming from your nipple. If your provider suggests that you have a breast biopsy, it doesn't mean you have breast cancer. Most breast lumps and other changes that are checked with biopsies turn out to be benign, which means they are not cancer.1What happens during a breast biopsy? There are three main types of breast biopsy procedures. They are usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you go home the same day: Fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid. The biopsy takes about 15 minutes. Core needle biopsy uses a wide needle to remove one or more small tissue samples about the size of a grain of rice. Sometimes a small vacuum probe is used instead of a needle. The device gently suctions some tissue and removes it with a small rotating blade. A core needle biopsy takes between 15 minutes and an hour, depending on how it's done. Surgical biopsy (or open biopsy) is surgery to remove all or part of a lump.  The biopsy usually takes about an hour. Biopsies are often done using mammography, ultrasound, MRI, or x-rays to help see exactly where to take the tissue sample. Your procedure will vary depending on which method is used to guide the biopsy, but the general steps are usually the same. For a fine needle aspiration biopsy or a core needle biopsy: Your provider will clean the skin on your breast and give you a shot of medicine to numb the area, so you won't feel any pain. The shot may sting briefly. You may be sitting or lying down. If images are used to guide the biopsy, you may lie on your side, back, or belly with your breast over an opening on the table. For a fine needle aspiration biopsy, your provider will insert the needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of cells or fluid. For a core biopsy, a tiny cut may be made to insert a wide needle or a vacuum device. You may feel a little pressure when the sample or samples are removed. Pressure will be applied to area until the bleeding stops. Your provider will cover the biopsy site with a sterile bandage. If you had a small incision, small strips of medical tape may be used to close the wound. For a surgical biopsy: You'll lie on an operating table. You may have an IV (intravenous line) in your arm or hand that may be used to give you medicine to relax. The skin over the biopsy area will be cleaned. To prevent pain, you'll have either:

A shot of medicine to numb your breast. The shot may sting briefly.
General anesthesia, which is medicine given through an IV to make you sleep.

 A shot of medicine to numb your breast. The shot may sting briefly. General anesthesia, which is medicine given through an IV to make you sleep. When you are numb or asleep, the surgeon will make a small cut in your breast tissue to remove part or all of the lump. In certain cases, tissue around the lump may also be removed. This may help avoid the need for more surgery if cancer cells are found in the lump. The cut in your skin will be closed with small strips of medical tape or stitches and covered with a sterile bandage. The type of biopsy you have will depend on: The size and location of the suspicious tissue in your breast How many areas of your breast are involved How abnormal the tissue looks on a mammogram or other image Your general health and preferences Ask your provider about why you need a biopsy and which type is right for you.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your provider will give you instructions for how to prepare for your biopsy. If you take any blood thinners, including aspirin, you may need to stop taking them before your biopsy. Tell your provider about all the medicines and supplements you take. Don't stop or start taking anything without talking with your provider first. If you're having general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. If you have general anesthesia or medicine to relax, you may be groggy after the procedure, so plan to have someone take you home.1Are there any risks to the test? It's common to have some bruising and temporary discomfort after a breast biopsy. Possible risks include: Infection, which can be treated with antibiotics Bleeding Your provider will give you instructions for how to care for biopsy area and manage any discomfort. If you're having general anesthesia, talk with your provider about how it may affect you. General anesthesia is very safe even for most people with other health conditions.1What do the results mean? It may take several days to a week to get your biopsy results. The results are called a pathology report. The report is written for your provider and will include a lot of medical terms. Your provider can explain what your report means. The most important part of your report will be the diagnosis. In general, your results will be one of these categories: Normal. No cancer or abnormal cells were found. Abnormal breast changes that aren't cancer and don't increase your risk for breast cancer. Some of these conditions often get better on their own and others may need treatment. 
Abnormal breast changes that increase your risk for breast cancer. These cells are not cancer, but if you have them, you are more likely to develop cancer.
If you had a needle biopsy that diagnosed a condition that increases your breast cancer risk, you may need a surgical biopsy to remove all the abnormal tissue. To find out what you can do to reduce your breast cancer risk, you will likely see a doctor who specializes in breast cancer.

Bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to look at your lungs. It uses a thin, lighted tube called a bronchoscope. The tube is put through the mouth or nose and moved down the throat and into the airways. It helps diagnose and treat certain lung diseases. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a procedure that is sometimes done during a bronchoscopy. It is also called bronchoalveolar washing. BAL is used to collect a sample from the lungs for testing. During the procedure, a saline solution is put through the bronchoscope to wash the airways and capture a fluid sample. Other names: flexible bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar washing1What are they used for? Bronchoscopy may be used to: Find and treat growths or other blockages in the airways Remove lung tumors Control bleeding in the airway Help find the cause of persistent cough If you've already been diagnosed with lung cancer, the test can help show how severe it is. Bronchoscopy with BAL is used to collect tissue for testing. These tests help diagnose different disorders of the lungs including: Bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia Fungal infections Lung cancer One or both tests may be used if an imaging test showed a potential problem with the lungs.1Why do I need bronchoscopy and BAL? You may need one or both tests if you have symptoms of a lung disease, such as: Persistent cough Trouble breathing Coughing up blood You may also need a BAL if you have an immune system disorder. Some immune system disorders, such as HIV/AIDS, can put you at higher risk for certain lung infections.1What happens during bronchoscopy and BAL? Bronchoscopy and BAL are often done by a pulmonologist. A pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases. A bronchoscopy usually includes the following steps: You may need to remove some or all of your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown. You will recline in a chair that is like a dentist's chair or sit on a procedure table with your head raised. You may get medicine (sedative) to help you relax. The medicine will be injected into a vein or given through an IV (intravenous) line that will be placed in your arm or hand. Your provider will spray a numbing medicine in your mouth and throat, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Your provider will insert the bronchoscope down your throat and into your airways. As the bronchoscope is moved down, your provider will examine your lungs. Your provider may perform other treatments at this time, such as removing a tumor or clearing a blockage. At this point, you may also get a BAL. During a BAL: Your provider will put a small amount of saline through the bronchoscope. After washing the airways, the saline is sucked up into the bronchoscope. The saline solution will contain cells and other substances, such as bacteria, which will be taken to a lab for testing.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your procedure. Your provider will let you know how long you need to avoid food and drink. You should also arrange to have someone drive you home. If you've been given a sedative, you may be drowsy for a few hours after your procedure.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a bronchoscopy or a BAL. The procedures may give you a sore throat for a few days. Serious complications are rare, but they may include bleeding in the airways, infection, or a collapsed part of a lung.1What do the results mean? If your bronchoscopy results were not normal, it may mean you have a lung disorder such as: A blockage, growth, or tumor in the airways Narrowing of part of the airways Lung damage due to an immune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis If you had BAL and your lung sample results were not normal, it may mean you have lung cancer or a type of infection such as: Tuberculosis Bacterial pneumonia Fungal infection If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about bronchoscopy and BAL? In addition to BAL, there are other procedures that can be done during a bronchoscopy. These include: Sputum culture. Sputum is a thick type of mucus made in your lungs. It is different than spit or saliva. A sputum culture checks for certain types of infections.

 BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) : 1What is a BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) Test? A BUN, or blood urea nitrogen test, can provide important information about your kidney function. The main job of your kidneys is to remove waste and extra fluid from your body. If you have kidney disease, this waste material can build up in your blood. Over time, this may lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, anemia, and heart disease. The BUN test measures the amount of urea nitrogen in your blood.  Urea nitrogen is a waste product that your kidneys remove from your blood. Higher than normal BUN levels may be a sign that your kidneys aren't working well. People with early kidney disease may not have any symptoms. A BUN test can help uncover kidney problems at an early stage when treatment can be more effective. Other names for a BUN test: Urea nitrogen test, serum BUN1What is it used for? A BUN test is often part of a series of tests called a comprehensive metabolic panel. It can help diagnose or monitor a kidney disease or disorder.1Why do I need a BUN test? Your health care provider may order a BUN test as part of a routine check-up or if you have or are at risk for a kidney problem. Early kidney disease usually does not have any signs or symptoms. You may be more likely to develop kidney disease if you have: Family of kidney problems Diabetes High blood pressure Heart disease Your provider may check your BUN levels if you are having symptoms of later stage kidney disease, such as: Needing to urinate (pee) more often or less often than usual Itching Fatigue Swelling in your legs, feet, or ankles Muscle cramps Trouble sleeping1What happens during a BUN test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Usually there is no special preparation necessary for a BUN test. But if your provider has ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Normal BUN levels can vary, but generally a high level of blood urea nitrogen is a sign that your kidneys are not working well. But abnormal results don't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Higher than normal BUN levels can also be caused by dehydration (too little fluid in your body), burns, certain medicines, a high protein diet, or other factors, including your age. BUN levels normally increase as you get older. To learn what your results mean, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a BUN test? A BUN test is only one type of measurement of kidney function. If your provider thinks you may have kidney disease, you may need other tests. These may include  tests to measure: Creatinine, which is another waste product that your kidneys remove from your body GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate), which estimates how well your kidneys are filtering blood1References Testing.com [Internet].

A burn is a type of injury to the skin and/or other tissues. The skin is the largest organ in your body. It is essential for protecting the body against injury and infection. It also helps control body temperature. When skin is injured or damaged by a burn, it can be very painful. Other health problems from a burn may include severe dehydration (the loss of too much fluid from your body), breathing troubles, and life-threatening infections. Burns can also cause permanent disfigurement and disability. A burn evaluation looks at how deep in the skin a burn has gone (degree of burns) and how much of the body's surface area has been burned. Burns are most often caused by: Heat, such as fire or hot liquids. These are known as thermal burns. Chemicals, such as acids or detergents. They can cause burns if they touch your skin or eyes. Electricity. You can get burned when an electrical current passes through your body. Sunlight. You can get a sunburn if you spend too much time in the sun, especially if you don't wear sunscreen. Radiation. These types of burns can be caused by certain cancer treatments. Friction. When skin rubs against a surface too roughly, it can cause an abrasion (scrape) known as a friction burn. Friction burns often happen in a bicycle or motorcycle accident when skin rubs against the pavement. Other causes include sliding down a rope too quickly and falling off a treadmill. Other names: burn assessment1What are the different types of burns? The types of burns are based on the depth of the injury, known as the degree of burns. There are three main types. First-degree burns. This is the least serious type of burn. It only affects the outermost layer of the skin, known as the epidermis. First-degree burns may cause pain and redness, but no blisters or open sores. A sunburn is a common type of first-degree burn. First-degree burns usually go away within a week or so. At-home treatments may include soaking the area in cool water and dressing it with a sterile bandage. Over-the-counter pain medicines can also relieve minor burn pain. Second-degree burns, also called partial thickness burns. These burns are more serious than first-degree burns. Second-degree burns affect the outer and the middle layer of the skin, known as the dermis. They can cause pain, redness, and blisters. Some second-degree burns can be treated with antibiotic creams and sterile bandages. More serious second-degree burns may need a procedure known as a skin graft. A skin graft uses natural or artificial skin to cover and protect the injured area while it heals. Second-degree burns can cause scarring. Third-degree burns, also called full thickness burns. This is a very serious type of burn. It affects the outer, middle, and innermost layers of the skin. The innermost layer is known as the fat layer. Third-degree burns often damage hair follicles, sweat glands, nerve endings, and other tissues in the skin. These burns can be severely painful. But if pain-sensing nerve cells have been damaged, there may be little or no pain at first. These burns can cause severe scarring and usually need to be treated with skin grafts. In addition to the type of degree, burns are also categorized as minor, moderate, or severe. Nearly all first-degree burns and some second-degree burns are considered minor. While they can be very painful, they rarely cause complications. Some second-degree burns and all third-degree burns are considered moderate or severe. Moderate and severe burns cause serious and sometimes fatal health problems.1How is a burn evaluation used? Burn evaluations are used to examine moderate to severe burn injuries. During a burn evaluation, your health care provider will carefully look at the wound. He or she will also figure out an estimated percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) that has been burned. Your provider may use a method known as the "rule of nines" to get this estimate. The rule of nines divides the body into sections of 9% or 18% (2 times 9). The sections are divided as follows: Head and neck: 9% of TBSA Each arm: 9% TBSA Each leg: 18% TBSA Anterior trunk (front of the body) 18% TBSA Posterior trunk (back of the body) 18% TBSA Rule of nines estimates are not used for children. Their bodies have different proportions than adults. If your child has a burn that covers a medium to large area, your provider may use a chart, called a Lund-Browder chart, to make an estimate. This gives more accurate estimates based on a child's age and body size. If you or your child has a burn that covers a small area, your provider may use an estimate based on the size of the palm, which is about 1% of TBSA.1What else happens during a burn evaluation? If you have a serious burn injury, you may also need an emergency evaluation known as an ABCDE assessment. ABCDE assessments are used to check key body systems and functions. They often take place in ambulances, emergency rooms, and hospitals. They are used for different types of traumatic emergencies, including severe burns. "ABCDE" stands for the following checks: Airway. A health care provider will check for any blockages in your airway. Breathing. A provider will check for signs of trouble breathing, including coughing, rasping, or wheezing. The provider may use a stethoscope to monitor your breath sounds. Circulation. A provider will use devices to check your heart and blood pressure. He or she may insert a thin tube called a catheter into your vein. A catheter is a thin tube that carries fluids into your body. Burns can often cause serious fluid loss. Disability. A provider will check for signs of brain damage. This includes checking to see how you respond to different verbal and physical stimulation. Exposure. A provider will remove any chemicals or burn-causing substances from the skin by flushing the injured area with water. He or she may bandage the area with a sterile dressing. The provider will also check your temperature, and warm you with a blanket and warm fluids if necessary.1Is there anything else I should know about a burn evaluation? Burns and fires are the fourth most common cause of accidental death in children and adults in the U.S. Young children, older adults, and people with disabilities are at a higher risk of burn injury and death. The vast majority of burn accidents can be prevented with some simple safety precautions. These include: Set your water heater to 120°F. Test the water temperature before you or your child gets into the tub or shower. Turn handles of pots and pans toward the back of the stove, or use back burners. Use smoke alarms in your home and check batteries every six months. Check electrical cords every few months. Throw out any that are frayed or damaged. Put covers on electrical outlets that are within a child's reach. If you smoke, never smoke in bed. Fires caused by cigarettes, pipes, and cigars are the leading cause of deaths in house fires. Be very careful when using space heaters. Keep them away from blankets, clothes, and other flammable materials. Never leave them unattended. To learn more about burn treatment or prevention, talk to your health care provider or your child's provider.1References Agrawal A, Raibagkar SC, Vora HJ. Friction Burns: Epidemiology and Prevention.

This test measures the level of C-peptide in a sample of your blood or urine (pee). Measuring C-peptide is an accurate way to find out how much insulin your body is making. Insulin is a hormone that your pancreas makes. It helps blood glucose (blood sugar) get into your cells, where it can be used for energy. This helps keep your blood glucose at healthy levels. During the process of making insulin, your pancreas produces C-peptide. C-peptide and insulin enter your bloodstream at the same time and in equal amounts. C-peptide doesn't affect your blood glucose levels, but it stays in your blood longer than insulin, so it's easier to measure accurately. A C-peptide test can provide important information to help understand, monitor, and/or treat disorders that involve how well your body makes insulin, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and diabetes. Other names: insulin C-peptide, connecting peptide insulin, proinsulin C-peptide1What is it used for? A C-peptide test may be used to help: Find the cause of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Some types of hypoglycemia are linked to high insulin levels. A C-peptide test can tell you whether too much insulin is involved in your condition. Possible causes of hypoglycemia include:

Liver or kidney disease
Malnutrition
Drinking too much alcohol without eating
A tumor in your pancreas (uncommon)
Side effects from certain diabetes medicines, including insulin.

 Liver or kidney disease Malnutrition Drinking too much alcohol without eating A tumor in your pancreas (uncommon) Side effects from certain diabetes medicines, including insulin. Manage diabetes treatment. If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, treatment decisions may depend on knowing how much insulin your pancreas is producing. A C-peptide test can provide an accurate measurement, even if you take insulin for diabetes. That's because your C-peptide levels depend on how much insulin your pancreas makes.  They aren't affected by insulin that you take. Monitor treatment for a tumor in your pancreas, called an insulinoma (uncommon). These tumors make too much insulin and cause low blood sugar. They are almost always benign (not cancer) and can usually be removed with surgery. To find out whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes if your diagnosis is uncertain. Usually, your health care provider can diagnose which type of diabetes you have. But in certain cases, it can be hard to tell for sure. If your diabetes diagnosis is uncertain after 3 years, a C-peptide test may be needed.1Why do I need a C-peptide test? You may need a C-peptide test if: You have been diagnosed with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) but don't know what's causing it. You have diabetes and you:

Take insulin, and your provider is considering changing your treatment.
Have type 2 diabetes, and your provider wants to see if you need to start taking insulin.
Have hypoglycemia, which could be caused by taking too much diabetes medicines.

 Take insulin, and your provider is considering changing your treatment. Have type 2 diabetes, and your provider wants to see if you need to start taking insulin. Have hypoglycemia, which could be caused by taking too much diabetes medicines. You have been diagnosed with a pancreatic tumor (insulinoma). A C-peptide test can help monitor your condition and treatment.1What happens during a C-peptide test? A C-peptide test usually uses a sample of your blood. But the test may also be done on a sample of all your urine collected over a 24-hour period. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a 24-hour urine sample test, you will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual.  Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? For a C-peptide blood test, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 8–12 hours before the test. Ask your provider if there are any specific instructions you need to follow before either a blood or a urine test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to a urine test.1What do the results mean? The meaning of your results depends on your age, health, the medicines you take, and the results of other tests, such as a blood glucose test. In general: A high level of C-peptide usually means that your body is making too much insulin. Conditions that cause high insulin levels include:

Type 2 diabetes
Cushing's syndrome
Insulinoma, a tumor in your pancreas
Kidney failure
A low level of potassium in your blood

 Type 2 diabetes Cushing's syndrome Insulinoma, a tumor in your pancreas Kidney failure A low level of potassium in your blood A low level of C-peptide may mean your body isn't making enough insulin. Conditions that cause low insulin levels include:

Type 1 diabetes and, in some cases, type 2 diabetes
Taking too much insulin to treat diabetes (Taking more insulin than you need may block your pancreas from making insulin on its own.)
A severe infection
Addison disease
Liver disease

 Type 1 diabetes and, in some cases, type 2 diabetes Taking too much insulin to treat diabetes (Taking more insulin than you need may block your pancreas from making insulin on its own.) A severe infection Addison disease Liver disease If you have been treated for an insulin-producing tumor in your pancreas, a decrease in your C-peptide levels means your treatment is working. An increase in your C-peptide may mean that your tumor is back. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a C-peptide test? A C-peptide test is not used to diagnose diabetes. Other tests, such as blood glucose and urine glucose, are used to screen for and diagnose diabetes.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

A c-reactive protein test measures the level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in a sample of your blood. CRP is a protein that your liver makes. Normally, you have low levels of c-reactive protein in your blood. Your liver releases more CRP into your bloodstream if you have inflammation in your body. High levels of CRP may mean you have a serious health condition that causes inflammation. Inflammation is your body's way of protecting your tissues and helping them heal from an injury, infection, or other disease. Inflammation can be acute (sudden) and temporary. This type of inflammation is usually helpful. For example, if you cut your skin, it may turn red, swell, and hurt for a few days. Those are signs of inflammation. Inflammation can also happen inside your body. If inflammation lasts too long, it can damage healthy tissues. This is called chronic (long-term) inflammation. Chronic infections, certain autoimmune disorders, and other diseases can cause harmful chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation can also happen if your tissues are repeatedly injured or irritated, for example from smoking or chemicals in the environment. A CRP test can show whether you have inflammation in your body and how much. But the test can't show what's causing the inflammation or which part of your body is inflamed. Other names: c-reactive protein, serum1What is it used for? A CRP test may be used to help find or monitor inflammation in acute or chronic conditions, including: Infections from bacteria or viruses Inflammatory bowel disease, disorders of the intestines that include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis Lung diseases, such as asthma Your health care provider may use a CRP test to see if treatments for chronic inflammation are working or to make treatment decisions if you have sepsis. Sepsis is your body's extreme response to an infection that spreads to your blood. It's a life-threatening medical emergency.1Why do I need a CRP test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection, such as: Fever or chills Rapid heart rate Rapid breathing Nausea and vomiting You may also need a CRP test if your provider thinks you may have a chronic condition that causes inflammation. The symptoms will depend on the condition. If you've already been diagnosed with an infection or a chronic disease that causes inflammation, you may need this test to monitor your condition and treatment. CRP levels rise and fall depending on how much inflammation is in your body. If your CRP levels fall, it's a sign that your treatment for inflammation is working or you're healing on your own.1What happens during a CRP test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This process usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Some medicines may affect your results. So, tell your provider about any supplements or medicines that you take, including ibuprofen, aspirin, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Don't stop taking any prescription medicines without talking with your provider first.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your CRP test results tell you how much inflammation you have in your body. But your test results can't tell you what's causing the inflammation. To make a diagnosis, your provider will look at your CRP results along with the results of other tests, your symptoms, and medical history. In general, healthy people have very low amounts of CRP in their blood. Any increases above normal mean you have inflammation in your body. But labs measure CRP levels in different ways, and they define "normal" CRP ranges differently, so it's best to ask your provider what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CRP test? A CRP test is sometimes confused with a high-sensitivity-(hs) CRP test. They both measure CRP, but they are used for different conditions. An hs-CRP test measures very tiny increases in your CRP levels. It is used to estimate your risk of heart disease.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/tu6309 C. diff Testing : 1What is C. diff testing? C. diff testing checks for signs of a C. diff infection, a serious, sometimes life-threatening disease of the digestive tract. C. diff, also known as C. difficile, stands for Clostridium difficile. It is a type of bacteria found in your digestive tract. There are many types of bacteria that live in your digestive system. Most are "healthy" or "good" bacteria, but some are harmful or "bad." The good bacteria help with digestion and control the growth of bad bacteria. Sometimes, the balance of good and bad bacteria gets upset. This is most often caused by some types of antibiotics, which can kill both good and bad bacteria. C. diff is not normally harmful. But when the bacteria in the digestive system get out of balance, C. diff bacteria can grow out of control. When C. diff gets overgrown, it makes toxins that are released into the digestive tract. This condition is known as a C. diff infection. A C. diff infection causes symptoms that range from mild diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the large intestine. It is especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems. C. diff infections are most often caused by the use of certain antibiotics. But C. diff can also be contagious. C. diff bacteria are passed into stool. The bacteria can spread from person to person when a someone with an infection doesn't thoroughly wash their hands after a bowel movement. They may then spread the bacteria to food and other surfaces they touch. If you come in contact with a contaminated surface and then touch your mouth, you may get the infection. Other names: C. difficile, Clostridium difficile, Glutamate dehydrogenase test GDH Clostridioides difficile, C. difficile toxin test1What is it used for? C. diff testing is most often used to find out if diarrhea is being caused by C. diff bacteria.1Why do I need C. diff testing? You may need C. diff testing if you have any of the following symptoms, especially if you've recently taken antibiotics. Watery diarrhea three or more times a day, lasting for more than four days Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Blood or mucus in the stool Weight loss You are more likely to need C. diff testing if you have these symptoms, along with certain risk factors. You are at higher risk for getting a C. diff infection if you: Are aged 65 or older Live in a nursing home or health care facility Are a patient in a hospital Have inflammatory bowel disease or other disorder of the digestive system Recently had gastrointestinal surgery Are getting chemotherapy for cancer Have a weakened immune system Had a previous C. diff infection1What happens during C. diff testing? You will need to provide a sample of your stool. Testing may include tests for the C. diff toxins, bacteria, and/or genes that make the toxins. But all tests can be performed on the same sample. Your provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following: Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves. Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab. If you have diarrhea, you can tape a large plastic bag to the toilet seat. It may be easier to collect your stool this way. You will then put the bag into the container. Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample. Seal and label the container. Remove the gloves, and wash your hands. Return the container to your health care provider as soon as possible. C. diff toxins may be harder to find when stool is not tested quickly enough. If you are unable to get to your provider right away, you should refrigerate your sample until you are ready deliver it.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for C. diff testing.1Are there any risks to testing? There is no known risk to having C. diff testing.1What do the results mean? If your results were negative, it probably means your symptoms are not being caused by C. diff bacteria, or that there was a problem with testing your sample. Your health care provider may retest you for C. diff and/or order more tests to help make a diagnosis. If your results were positive, it means your symptoms are likely being caused by C. diff bacteria. If you are diagnosed with a C. diff infection and are currently taking antibiotics, you will probably need to stop taking them. Other treatments for a C. diff infection may include: Taking a different type of antibiotics. Your provider may prescribe antibiotics that target C. diff bacteria. Taking probiotics, a type of supplement. Probiotics are considered "good bacteria." They are helpful to your digestive system. If C. diff infections keep returning after you've been treated, your provider may recommend a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). It's also known as stool transplantation. In this procedure, stool from a healthy donor is transplanted into your colon. Research has shown that FMT is very successful in treating recurrent C. diff infections. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). So it is still considered experimental. You can talk with your provider about whether this is an option for you. If you have questions about your results and/or treatment, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about C .diff testing? Clostridium difficile has been renamed Clostridioides Clostridioides difficile. But the older name is still frequently used. The change does not affect the commonly used abbreviations, C. diff and C. difficile.1References Familydoctor.org [Internet]. Leawood (KS): American Academy of Family Physicians; c2019.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425030 CA 19-9 Blood Test (Pancreatic Cancer) : 1What is a CA 19-9 blood test? A CA 19-9 test measures the amount of a protein called CA 19-9 (cancer antigen 19-9) in a sample of your blood. CA 19-9 is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in your body. Healthy people can have small amounts of CA 19-9 in their blood. High levels of CA 19-9 are often a sign of pancreatic cancer. But high levels can also be a sign of other types of cancer or certain conditions that aren't cancer. For example, gallstones and cirrhosis of the liver can cause high CA 19-9 levels. Because high levels of CA 19-9 can mean different things, the test is not used by itself to screen for or diagnose cancer or other diseases. But it can help monitor your cancer and check how well your treatment is working. Other names: cancer antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, CA 199 measurement, CA 19-9 radioimmunoassay (RIA)1What is it used for? CA 19-9 blood tests may be used to: Monitor certain types of cancer and cancer treatment. CA 19-9 levels often go up as cancer grows and go down as tumors shrink. Help predict how cancer may behave over time. Check whether cancer has returned after treatment. Help diagnose certain cancers and other diseases when used with other tests. Some people do not make CA 19-9 even when they have a cancer that usually produces high levels of CA 19-9. For these people, a CA 19-9 tumor marker test is not useful.1Why do I need a CA 19-9 test? You may need a CA 19-9 blood test if you've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or another type of cancer that causes high CA 19-9. These include cancers of the: Bile duct Colon and rectum Stomach Ovaries Bladder During cancer treatment, your health care provider may test you on a regular basis to see if your treatment is working. After your treatment is complete, you may need to have CA 19-9 tests to check whether the cancer has come back. High levels of CA 19-9 may be one of the first signs that cancer cells are growing again.1What happens during a CA 19-9 blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Usually, you don't need any special preparations for a CA 19-9 blood test. But ask your provider to be sure. If you take certain vitamins, you may need to stop them before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you're being treated for cancer, you may be tested several times during your treatment. Your provider will look at all your test results to see how your CA 19-9 levels have changed.  Your results may show: Your levels of CA 19-9 are increasing. This may mean your tumor is growing, and/or your treatment is not working. More tests are usually needed to find out for sure. Your levels of CA 19-9 are decreasing. This may mean your tumor is shrinking and your treatment is working. Your levels of CA 19-9 have stayed the same. This may mean your disease is stable and hasn't gotten better or worse. Your CA 19-9 levels decreased after treatment, but increased later. This may mean your cancer has come back or grown. You'll need more tests to check whether cancer is really causing the higher level of CA 19-9. If you don't have cancer but your test results show a high level of CA 19-9, you may not a health problem that needs treatment. Healthy people can have high CA 19-9 levels. But high levels may be a sign of a condition, such as: Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas Gallstones Bile duct disease, including a blockage or infection Liver disease Cystic fibrosis Talk with your provider about what your results may mean. If your provider thinks you may have one of these conditions, you will probably need other tests to find out for sure. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CA 19-9 test? Labs use different methods to measure the amount of CA 19-9 in your blood sample. The test method can affect your results. If you're having regular tests to monitor cancer, it's important to have your tests done the same way, and usually in the same lab.  This allows your provider to compare your results over time. Your test report usually says what method was used to measure your CA 19-9 levels. If you have any questions about how your tests are done, talk with your provider.1References Allina Health [Internet].

This test measures the amount of a protein called CA-125 (cancer antigen 125) in a sample of your blood. CA-125 is a type of tumor marker. High levels of certain tumor markers in your blood may be a sign of cancer. If you have cancer, measuring certain tumor markers may help provide important information about how to treat your disease. High levels of CA-125 are often found in people who have ovarian cancer. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive glands that store ova (eggs) and make female hormones. Ovarian cancer happens when the cells in an ovary begin to grow out of control. If you have ovarian cancer, CA-125 blood tests can help show whether your treatment is working. Other names: cancer antigen 125, glycoprotein antigen, ovarian cancer antigen, CA-125 tumor marker1What is it used for? A CA-125 blood test may be used: To see if ovarian cancer treatment is working and to check for ovarian cancer that has come back. This is the most common use of CA-125 blood testing.  To learn more about a growth or lump in your pelvis (the area below your belly). If a suspicious lump shows up on imaging, such as an ultrasound, your health care provider may check your CA-125 levels along with other tests to find out whether the lump could be ovarian cancer. But a CA-125 blood test alone can't diagnose cancer. To screen for ovarian cancer if you're risk is very high. If your family health history includes ovarian cancer, your provider may suggest a CA-125 blood test and other tests to look for signs of cancer. But a CA-125 test is not used as a routine screening test for people who don't have a high risk for ovarian cancer. That's because many common conditions that aren't cancer can also cause high CA-125 levels, such as endometriosis or even a menstrual period.1Why do I need a CA-125 blood test? If you've been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have several CA-125 blood tests: During your treatment to see if your cancer is going away. If CA-125 levels go down, it usually means your treatment is working After your treatment, to check whether your cancer has returned If you have a lump in your pelvis that could be ovarian cancer, you may need a CA-125 test to help find out if it could be ovarian cancer. But only a biopsy can diagnose ovarian cancer. If you have a very high risk of getting ovarian cancer, your health care provider may suggest checking your CA-125 levels. If they're high, you'll probably need more tests to find out if you have cancer. You're more likely to get ovarian cancer if you: Have a mother or sister, or two or more other relatives who had ovarian cancer Have family members who have had breast cancer or colorectal cancer (colon cancer) Have inherited certain gene changes or conditions that increase your risk of ovarian cancer, such as:


Changes in your genes, including BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes
Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), an inherited disorder that increases the risk for many types of cancer

 Changes in your genes, including BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), an inherited disorder that increases the risk for many types of cancer Have had breast, uterine (uterus), or colorectal cancer If you're concerned about getting ovarian cancer, talk with your provider about your risk.1What happens during a CA-125 blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a CA-125 blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider will review your CA-125 test results along with other information about your condition. Together, you can discuss how your results affect your diagnosis, treatment, and need for more testing. In general: If you are being treated for ovarian cancer, and the results of several tests show that your CA-125 levels are going down, it usually means that the treatment is helping.  If your levels go up or stay the same over time, it may mean that the treatment isn't working. If you have finished your treatment for ovarian cancer and your CA-125 levels begin to increase over time, your cancer may be coming back. If you have a high risk for ovarian cancer or have a suspicious pelvic lump, a high CA-125 levels could be a sign of cancer. Your provider will usually order more tests to make a diagnosis. A high CA-125 level doesn't always mean cancer. Other conditions may increase CA-125, including: Endometriosis Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Uterine fibroids Liver disease Pregnancy Your menstrual period, at certain times during your cycle A normal CA-125 test result doesn't rule out ovarian cancer. That's because CA-125 levels may be low in the early stages of cancer. And not everyone with ovarian cancer makes high levels of CA-125. Talk with your provider if you have questions about your results. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CA-125 blood test? The most common type of ovarian cancer is epithelial ovarian cancer. If you have been treated for this type of cancer, you may be tested for a tumor marker called HE4 along with CA-125. Some studies show that measuring both tumor markers provides more accurate information to check whether treatment is working and to look for the return of this type of cancer.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw45058 Calcitonin Test : 1What is a calcitonin test? A calcitonin test measures the level of calcitonin in a sample of your blood. Calcitonin is a hormone that helps control the level of calcium in your blood. Calcitonin is made in your thyroid gland by cells called "C cells." Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in your neck. Normally, you have a small amount of calcitonin in your blood. But if you have too much, it may be a sign of: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a rare cancer that happens when C cells in your thyroid grow out of control. C cells grow in the inside part of your thyroid, which is called the medulla. C-cell hyperplasia, a rare condition that causes abnormal growth of C cells in your thyroid. C-cell hyperplasia can turn into medullary thyroid carcinoma. Your health care provider may order a calcitonin test if you have symptoms of these conditions or if they run in your family. Other names: thyrocalcitonin, CT, human calcitonin, hCT1What is it used for? A calcitonin test is most often used to: Help diagnose C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer in people who have symptoms Find out if treatment for medullary thyroid cancer is working Check whether medullary thyroid cancer has returned after treatment Screen people who have a high risk of medullary thyroid cancer. The risk is high for people who have a family history of a rare genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). There are different types of MEN 2 that often cause tumors in certain glands that make hormones, including your thyroid. All types of MEN 2 increase your risk of medullary thyroid cancer. MEN 2 is caused by changes in a gene called RET. Changes in genes are also called gene variants or mutations. You can inherit MEN 2 - and an increased risk for medullary thyroid cancer - if either of your parents passed a changed RET gene down to you. If MEN 2 runs in your family, regular calcitonin tests can help find cancer early when it may be easier to treat.1Why do I need a calcitonin test? You may need a calcitonin test to help check for medullary thyroid cancer or C-cell hyperplasia if: You have symptoms of either condition which may include:

A lump in the front of your neck
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck (also called "swollen glands")
Pain in your throat
Trouble swallowing or breathing
A change in your voice, such as hoarseness
A long-lasting cough when you don't have a cold
Diarrhea

 A lump in the front of your neck Swollen lymph nodes in your neck (also called "swollen glands") Pain in your throat Trouble swallowing or breathing A change in your voice, such as hoarseness A long-lasting cough when you don't have a cold Diarrhea You have symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). MEN 2 can affect your thyroid, adrenal, and parathyroid glands. Symptoms depend on which glands are affected. They may include:

Fatigue
Depression
Aches and pains in bones and joints
Nausea and vomiting
Increased thirst and urination (peeing)
High blood pressure
Headaches
Arrythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heart)
Sweating

 Fatigue Depression Aches and pains in bones and joints Nausea and vomiting Increased thirst and urination (peeing) High blood pressure Headaches Arrythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heart) Sweating You have a family history of MEN 2, which increases your risk of developing medullary thyroid cancer. If MEN 2 runs in your family, you and your family members, including children, may need regular calcitonin tests to help find cancer before you have symptoms. Your provider may also suggest a blood test to check for changes in your RET genes that cause MEN 2. If you've been diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer, you'll need calcitonin testing to: Find out how well your treatment is working. Check whether the cancer has come back after you finish treatment.1What happens during a calcitonin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The meaning of your calcitonin test results depends on the reason you were tested. If you had a calcitonin test: To help diagnose or screen for medullary thyroid cancer or C-cell hyperplasia: A normal calcitonin level may mean that you don't have either condition, but it doesn't rule them out. That's because medullary thyroid cancer and C-cell hyperplasia don't always cause high calcitonin. Your provider may order other tests to learn more. A high calcitonin level means that the C cells in your thyroid are making too much calcitonin. The higher the level, the more likely it is that you have medullary thyroid cancer or C-cell hyperplasia. But high calcitonin levels may be caused by other conditions, including certain other cancers, certain medicines, and pregnancy. To make a diagnosis, your provider will consider other information, including other test results. A low calcitonin level is not known to be a medical problem. To monitor treatment for medullary thyroid cancer or to check whether cancer has come back after treatment: The meaning of your test results depends on the type of treatment you're having or had. Treatment usually starts with surgery to remove your thyroid gland. Other treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or medicines. In general: Calcitonin levels that decrease and stay low over time usually mean that your treatment is helping. A calcitonin level that decreases but is still higher than normal may mean that you still have some cancer tissue left in your body. You may need more tests and treatment. A calcitonin level that increases over time usually means that your cancer has returned or spread to other parts of your body. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean for your health. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a calcitonin test? In certain cases, your provider may order a more accurate type of calcitonin test called a "calcitonin stimulation test."  For this test, a sample of your blood will be taken as usual. Then you'll be given medicine to make your body produce calcitonin. The medicine is injected into a vein intravenously (by IV). Afterwards, more blood samples will be taken a few minutes apart.  If your calcitonin increases by a lot in each blood sample, it may mean you have C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid carcinoma, but you'll need other tests to find out for sure.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519054/ Calcium Blood Test : 1What is a Calcium Blood Test? A calcium blood test measures the amount of calcium in your blood. If there is too much or too little calcium in the blood, it may be a sign of a wide range of medical conditions, such as bone disease, thyroid disease, parathyroid disorders, kidney disease, and other conditions. Calcium is one of the most important minerals in your body. About 1% of the calcium in your body is in your blood. The rest is stored in your bones and teeth. Having the right amount of calcium in your blood is necessary for your nerves, muscles, and heart to work properly. It also helps blood vessels move blood throughout your body and helps release hormones that affect many body functions. Other names: total calcium, ionized calcium1What is it used for? A blood calcium test is used to check your general health. It's also used to help diagnose or monitor many types of medical conditions, including conditions that affect your bones, kidneys, digestive system, thyroid, and parathyroid glands. There are two types of calcium blood tests that measure different forms of blood calcium: Total calcium test measures all the calcium in your blood. You have two types of blood calcium that are normally present in about equal amounts:

"Bound calcium" is attached to proteins in your blood.
"Free calcium" is not attached to proteins. It's also called ionized calcium. This form of blood calcium is active in many body functions.

Normally, your body tightly controls the balance of bound and ionized calcium, so a total calcium test gives a good estimate of how much ionized calcium you have.
A total calcium test is the most common test for blood calcium. It's often part of  a basic metabolic panel (BMP) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which are both routine screening tests.

A total calcium test is the most common test for blood calcium. It's often part of  a basic metabolic panel (BMP) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which are both routine screening tests. An ionized calcium test measures only the "free calcium" in your blood that isn't attached to proteins. An ionized calcium test is more difficult to do, so it's usually ordered if the results of a total calcium test aren't normal. You may also have this test if you have a condition that affects your body's ability to balance the amounts of ionized and bound calcium in your blood, or if you are seriously ill or having surgery.1Why do I need a calcium blood test? Your health care provider may have ordered a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel, which includes a calcium blood test, as part of your regular checkup. You may also have this test to diagnose or monitor conditions that can affect your blood calcium or if you have symptoms of abnormal calcium levels. Symptoms of high calcium levels include: Constipation Nausea and vomiting Abdominal (belly) pain Loss of appetite More frequent urination Increased thirst Confusion Symptoms of low calcium levels include: Dry skin, coarse hair, and nails that easily break (after a long period of low levels) Muscle cramps, spasms, or stiffness Tingling in the lips, tongue, fingers, and feet Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Many people with high or low calcium levels don't have any symptoms. So your provider may order a calcium test if you have a known condition that may affect your calcium levels, such as: Kidney disease Thyroid or parathyroid disease Malnutrition Problems absorbing calcium Certain types of cancer1What happens during a calcium blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for a calcium blood test or a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel. Your provider may ask you to stop taking certain medicines or supplements, such as vitamin D, to make sure your test results are accurate.  If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Results from a total calcium test that are higher than normal may be a sign of many types of conditions, such as: Overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism), a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone Certain types of cancer, including cancer that spreads to the bone Bone disorders, including Paget's disease of the bone Taking too much vitamin D over a long period of time Results from a total calcium test that are lower than normal may be a sign of: Low blood protein levels, which may be caused by liver disease or malnutrition Underactive parathyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism), a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too little parathyroid hormone Too little calcium in your diet Too little vitamin D or magnesium Pancreatitis Kidney disease If your results from a total calcium blood test are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your diet and certain medicines can affect your calcium levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a calcium blood test? A calcium blood test does not tell you how much calcium is in your bones. Bone health can be measured with a type of x-ray called a bone density scan, or dexa scan. A dexa scan measures the mineral content, including calcium, and other aspects of your bones.1References Drake TM, Gupta V. Calcium. [Updated 2021 May 9; cited 2022 Mar 21].

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482128/ Calcium in Urine Test : 1What is a Calcium in Urine Test? A calcium in urine test measures the amount of calcium in your urine (pee). If your urine calcium levels are too high or too low, it may be a sign of kidney disease, kidney stones, bone disease, a parathyroid gland disorder, or other conditions. Calcium is one of the most important minerals in your body. Most of your calcium is stored in your bones and teeth. About 1% of the calcium in your body is in your blood. Having the right amount of calcium in your blood is necessary for your nerves, muscles, and heart to work properly. Normally, your kidneys filter out a small amount of calcium from your blood, which leaves your body in urine. Checking the amount of calcium in urine can help diagnose kidney problems and other conditions that can affect calcium levels in your blood. If you have symptoms of any of these conditions, your health care provider may order a calcium blood test, too. Other names: urinalysis (calcium), urinary Ca+21What is it used for? A calcium in urine test may be used to diagnose or monitor how well your kidney are working. It may be used if you have symptoms of kidney stones, which are more likely to form if you have too much calcium in your urine. A calcium in urine test may also help diagnose problems with the parathyroid glands in your neck. These glands help control the amount of calcium in your body.1Why do I need a calcium in urine test? You may need a calcium in urine test if you have symptoms of a kidney stone. These symptoms include: Sharp pain in your lower abdomen (belly), back, side, or groin Blood in your urine Frequent need to urinate (pee) Pain while urinating Inability to urinate or urinating only small amounts Cloudy or bad-smelling urine Nausea and vomiting You may also need a calcium in urine test if you have symptoms of a parathyroid disorder. Having too much parathyroid hormone doesn't always cause symptoms. When symptoms happen, they may include: Muscle weakness Fatigue Depression Bone and joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Constipation Confusion Increased thirst and urination Symptoms of too little parathyroid hormone include: Abdominal (belly) pain Muscle cramps Tingling fingers and toes Dry skin and hair Brittle nails1What happens during a calcium in urine test? You'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual.  Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may be asked to avoid certain foods and medicines for several days before the test. Do not stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a calcium in urine test.1What do the results mean? Higher than normal calcium levels in urine may be a sign of: A kidney stone Hyperparathyroidism (too much parathyroid hormone) Certain types of cancer, including cancer that spreads to the bones Paget's disease of bone Sarcoidosis  Too much vitamin D over a long period of time, usually from supplements Lower than normal calcium levels in urine may be a sign of: Hypoparathyroidism (too little parathyroid hormone) Kidney disease Hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone) Too little vitamin D or magnesium Malabsorption disorder Malnutrition If your calcium levels aren't normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your diet and certain supplements and medicines, including antacids, can affect your urine calcium levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.

A carbon dioxide (CO2) blood test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. Carbon dioxide is an odorless, colorless gas.  It is a waste product that your body makes when it uses food for energy. Your blood carries carbon dioxide to your lungs. When you exhale, you breathe out carbon dioxide. Having too much or too little carbon dioxide in your blood can be a sign of a health problem. Other names: carbon dioxide content, CO2 content, carbon dioxide blood test, bicarbonate blood test, bicarbonate test, total CO2; TCO2; carbon dioxide content; CO2 content; bicarb; HCO31What is it used for? Most of the carbon dioxide in your body is in the form of bicarbonate, which is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluid and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body. A CO2 blood test is often part of a group of tests called an electrolyte panel. An electrolyte panel may be part of a regular check-up. The test may also help diagnose or monitor conditions related to an electrolyte imbalance. These include high blood pressure and diseases of the kidneys, lungs, or liver.1Why do I need a CO2 in blood test? Your health care provider may order a CO2 blood test as part of your regular checkup or if you have symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance. These symptoms may include: Trouble breathing Confusion Weakness Fatigue  Vomiting and/or diarrhea over a long period of time Your provider may also order a CO2 blood test to check for side effects of certain medicines that can cause electrolyte imbalances.1What happens during a CO2 blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a CO2 blood test or an electrolyte panel. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Abnormal test results may be a sign that your body is having a hard time keeping the right acid-base balance (pH balance). This may be because your lungs or kidneys are having a problem removing carbon dioxide or because you have an electrolyte imbalance. Many different types of conditions can cause these problems. Too much CO2 in the blood can be a sign of many conditions, including: Lung diseases Cushing's syndrome Kidney failure Metabolic alkalosis, a condition in which your blood is not acidic enough. You may lose acid from conditions such as vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia. Too little CO2 in the blood may be a sign of: Addison disease, a complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes Diabetic ketoacidosis Shock Metabolic acidosis, a condition in which your blood is too acidic. It may be caused by many things, including kidney or liver disease, or long-lasting diarrhea. Respiratory alkalosis, a condition in which your blood is not acidic enough because of lung or breathing disorders, including hyperventilation (rapid, deep breathing). If your test results are not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Other factors, including certain medicines, can affect the level of CO2 in your blood. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CO2 blood test? Some prescription and over-the-counter medicines can increase or decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. Be sure to tell your provider about any medicines you are taking.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K. Brunner & Suddarth's Handbook of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests. 2nd Ed, Kindle.

Catecholamines are hormones made by your adrenal glands, two small glands located above your kidneys. These hormones are released into the body in response to physical or emotional stress. The main types of catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Epinephrine is also known as adrenaline. Catecholamine tests measure the amount of these hormones in your urine or blood. Higher than normal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or epinephrine can be a sign of a serious health condition. Other names: dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine tests, free catecholamines1What are they used for? Catecholamine tests are most often used to diagnose or rule out certain types of rare tumors, including: Pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands. This type of tumor is usually benign (not cancerous). But it can be fatal if left untreated. Neuroblastoma, a cancerous tumor that develops from nerve tissue. It mostly affects infants and children. Paraganglioma, a type of tumor that forms near the adrenal glands. This type of tumor is sometimes cancerous, but usually grows very slowly. The tests may also be used to see if treatments for these tumors are working.1Why do I need a catecholamine test? You or your child may need this test if you have symptoms of a tumor that affect catecholamine levels. Symptoms in adults include: High blood pressure, especially if it is not responding to treatment Severe headaches Sweating Rapid heartbeat Symptoms in children include: Bone pain or tenderness An abnormal lump in the abdomen Weight loss Uncontrolled eye movements1What happens during a catecholamine test? A catecholamine test may be done in urine or blood. Urine testing is done more often because catecholamine blood levels can change quickly and may also be affected by the stress of testing. But blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. If you have this tumor, certain substances will be released into the bloodstream. For a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Test instructions usually include the following steps: Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time. For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided. Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice. Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may be asked to avoid certain foods for two to three days before the test. These include: Caffeinated foods and drinks, such as coffee, tea, and chocolate Bananas Citrus fruits Foods that contain vanilla You may also be asked to avoid stress and vigorous exercise before your test, as these can affect cathecholamine levels. Certain medicines may also affect levels. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to having a urine test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show high levels of catecholamines in your urine or blood, it may mean you have a pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, or paraganglioma tumor. If you are being treated for one of these tumors, high levels may mean your treatment is not working. High levels of these hormones does not always mean you have a tumor. Your levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or epinephrine can be affected by stress, vigorous exercise, caffeine, smoking, and alcohol. If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about catecholamine tests? These tests can help diagnose certain tumors, but they can't tell whether the tumor is cancerous. Most tumors are not. If your results showed high levels of these hormones, your provider will probably order more tests. These include imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI, which can help your provider get more information about a suspected tumor. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References Cancer.Net [Internet]. Alexandria (VA): American Society of Clinical Oncology; 2005–2020.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/stp1348 CCP Antibody Test : 1What is a CCP antibody test? This test looks for CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies in the blood. CCP antibodies, also called anti-CCP antibodies, are a type of antibody called autoantibodies. Antibodies and autoantibodies are proteins made by the immune system. Antibodies protect you from disease by fighting foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. Autoantibodies can cause disease by attacking the body's healthy cells by mistake. CCP antibodies target healthy tissues in the joints. If CCP antibodies are found in your blood, it can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive, autoimmune disease that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. CCP antibodies are found in more than 75 percent of people who have rheumatoid arthritis. They are almost never found in people who don't have the disease. Other names:  Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, anticitrullinated peptide antibody, citrulline antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-CCP antibody, ACPA1What is it used for? A CCP antibody test is used to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. It's often done along with or after a rheumatoid factor (RF) test. Rheumatoid factors are another type of autoantibody. RF tests used to be the main test to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. But RF factors can be found in people with other autoimmune diseases and even in some healthy people. Many studies have shown that CCP antibodies provide a more accurate diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis compared with RF testing.1Why do I need a CCP antibody test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These include: Joint pain Joint stiffness, especially in the morning Joint swelling Fatigue Low-grade fever You may also need this test if other tests couldn't confirm or rule out a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.1What happens during a CCP antibody test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Be sure to tell your health care provider about all medicines, vitamins, and dietary supplements you are taking. You may need to stop taking certain substances for 8 hours before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your CCP antibody results were positive, it means these antibodies were found in your blood. A negative result means no CCP antibodies were found. The meaning of these results may depend on the results of a rheumatoid factor (RF) test as well as a physical exam. If you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and your results show: Positive CCP antibodies and positive RF, it likely means that you have rheumatoid arthritis. Positive CCP antibodies and negative RF, it may mean you are in the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis or will develop it in the future. Negative CCP antibodies and negative RF, it means you are less likely to have rheumatoid arthritis. Your provider may need to do more tests to help find out what is causing your symptoms. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CCP antibody test? Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose, especially in its early stages. Your provider may order one or more tests in addition to CCP antibody and RF tests. These include x-rays of your joints and the following blood tests: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Synovial fluid analysis C-reactive protein Antinuclear antibody These blood tests can show signs of inflammation. Inflammation is a type of immune system response. It can be a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis.1References Abdul Wahab A, Mohammad M, Rahman MM, Mohamed Said MS.

A CD4 count is a blood test that measures the number of CD4 cells in a sample of your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell. They're also called CD4 T lymphocytes or "helper T cells." That's because they help fight infection by triggering your immune system to destroy viruses, bacteria, and other germs that may make you sick. A CD4 count is mostly used to check the health of your immune system if you are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells. Without treatment, HIV may destroy so many CD4 cells that your immune system will have trouble fighting off infections. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). AIDS is the most serious stage of an HIV infection. If you have AIDS, your CD4 count is so low that you may develop serious infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungi that usually don't cause problems in healthy people. These are called "opportunistic infections," and they can become life-threatening.  AIDS increases your risk of developing certain cancers, too. Most people with HIV don't have AIDS. And if they take their HIV medicine as prescribed, they may never develop AIDS. If you have HIV, a CD4 count can help your health care provider check your risk for serious infections. A CD4 count may also be used to help diagnose and monitor certain other conditions that affect your immune system. Other names: CD4 lymphocyte count CD4+ count, T4 count, T-helper cell count, CD4 percent1What is it used for? If you have HIV, a CD4 count may be used to: See how HIV is affecting your immune system. CD4 counts can help monitor your risk for developing opportunistic infections or certain cancers. If your risk increases, your provider may give you treatment to help prevent infections. Help check how well HIV treatment is working. A CD4 count is used with a test called an HIV viral load test to see if HIV medicines are working. A viral load tests measures how much HIV is in your blood. Diagnose AIDS. Without treatment, HIV can lead to a very low CD4 count, which means you have AIDS. A CD4 count may also be used to: Monitor treatment after an organ transplant. If you've had an organ transplantation, you'll need to take medicine to prevent your immune system from attacking the new organ. These medicines are called "anti-rejection" drugs or immunosuppressants. You may also take these medicines to treat certain autoimmune diseases.  A low CD4 count means the medicine is working. Help diagnose different types of lymphoma. A CD4 count may be used with other tests to find out which type of immune cells are causing lymphoma. The test results help choose the right treatment. Help diagnose DiGeorge syndrome. This is an uncommon inherited disorder that often causes immune problems and other health conditions that start at birth.1Why do I need a CD4 count? Your provider may order a CD4 count when you are first diagnosed with HIV. You will probably be tested again every few months to see if your counts have changed since your first test. If you are taking medicine for HIV, your provider may order regular CD4 counts with an HIV viral load test to see how well your medicines are working.1What happens during a CD4 count? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a CD4 count.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? CD4 results are usually given as a number of cells per cubic millimeter of blood. But labs may have different ways of describing "normal" CD4 counts. What's normal for you depends on your age, other health conditions, and the medicines you may take. That's why it's important to talk with your provider about what your test results mean. CD4 counts may change even when your health has not changed. So, your provider will usually look at a few test results over time to see if there's a trend in your CD4 counts. In general, ranges for CD4 counts are: Normal CD4 count for healthy adults and teens: 500 to 1,200 cells per cubic millimeter Low CD4 count: Below 500 cells per cubic millimeter

If you have HIV, a low CD4 count means that HIV has weakened your immune system. A CD4 count of 200 or fewer cells per cubic millimeter means that you have AIDS. With AIDS you have a high risk of developing life-threatening infections or cancers.
If you don't have HIV, a low CD4 count may be caused by an infection.  Cancer chemotherapy and medicines that weaken your immune system may also cause low CD4 counts. In certain cases, the cause of a low CD4 count is unknown, but this is uncommon.

 If you have HIV, a low CD4 count means that HIV has weakened your immune system. A CD4 count of 200 or fewer cells per cubic millimeter means that you have AIDS.

Cancer chemotherapy and medicines that weaken your immune system may also cause low CD4 counts. In certain cases, the cause of a low CD4 count is unknown, but this is uncommon. High CD4 Count: Counts above the normal range may be sign of an infection or a blood cancer. While there is no cure for HIV, there are different medicines that you can take to control the virus and protect your immune system. In fact, CD4 counts usually increase with these medicines, which helps keep you healthy. If you are living with HIV, it's important to take your medicine as prescribed and get regular blood tests, including CD4 counts.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5897899/ CEA Test : 1What is a CEA test? CEA stands for carcinoembryonic antigen. CEA is a protein that is a type of "tumor marker." Tumor markers are substances that are often made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer. High levels of CEA are normal in healthy, unborn babies. After birth, CEA levels become very low or disappear completely. So, healthy adults should have little or no CEA in their bodies. Cancers that may cause high levels of CEA include cancers of the: Colon and rectum (colorectal or bowel cancer) Prostate Ovary Lung Thyroid Liver Pancreas Breast If you've been diagnosed with a cancer that can cause high CEA levels, CEA testing may help your health care provider learn more about your cancer and chance of recovery. The test is often used with other tests to check if cancer treatment is working. CEA tests are not used to screen for or diagnose cancer. That's because: Cancers that often cause high CEA levels don't always cause high levels. You can have normal CEA test results even though you have one of these cancers. Many other health problems that aren't cancer can make CEA levels rise, including certain conditions that affect your liver, digestion, or breathing. Most CEA tests use a sample of your blood to measure your CEA level. Sometimes the test uses a sample of fluid from your spine, chest, or abdomen (belly), but this is less common. Other names: CEA assay, CEA blood test, carcinoembryonic antigen test1What is it used for? A CEA test is mostly used in people who have been diagnosed with cancers that often increase CEA levels. It's most commonly used in colorectal cancer. A provider may order a CEA test along with other tests to: Learn more about a cancer soon after it has been diagnosed. CEA levels can help predict the likelihood of recovery and/or the chance that cancer will come back after treatment. Check how well cancer treatment is working. See if cancer has returned after treatment.1Why do I need a CEA test? If you've been diagnosed with a type of cancer that can cause high CEA levels, you may need CEA testing: Before treatment to:

Help understand how serious your cancer is.
Help guide treatment decisions.
Get a measurement of your CEA level before treatment to compare with CEA levels after treatment.

 Help understand how serious your cancer is. Help guide treatment decisions. Get a measurement of your CEA level before treatment to compare with CEA levels after treatment. During cancer treatment to see if the treatment working. After treatment to check whether cancer has come back. You may need to have tests on a regular schedule.1What happens during a CEA test? CEA is usually measured with a blood sample. During a CEA blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Sometimes, CEA is tested in other body fluids. For these tests, your provider will remove a small sample of fluid using a thin needle.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? For a CEA blood test, you usually don't need to prepare. If you smoke, you may need to stop for a while before your test. That's because smoking increases CEA levels.1Are there any risks to the test? A CEA blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? To understand your CEA test results, your provider will consider the results of other tests and exams. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean for your health and treatment. If you had a test before starting cancer treatment, in general: A low level of CEA may mean your tumor is small and the cancer has not spread to other parts of your body. But some cancers don't make much CEA, so your provider may use other tests to learn more about how much cancer you have and if it's spread. A high level of CEA may mean you have a larger tumor and/or your cancer has spread. You'll need other tests to confirm how serious your cancer is. If you had a test to monitor your cancer during or after treatment, your provider will compare your current CEA test results with your past test results. In general: Decreases in CEA over time often mean that treatment is working. Increases in CEA or high levels that stay high may mean that treatment isn't working. For example, if you had surgery for colorectal cancer, these levels may mean that the entire tumor wasn't removed or the cancer is growing back. Decreases in CEA after treatment followed by increases may mean cancer has come back. CEA levels that remain high or increase after treatment don't always mean that treatment isn't working, or cancer is growing. So, if your CEA levels don't come down, your provider will likely order other tests to find out why. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CEA test? Labs use different methods to measure CEA. The test method can affect your results. So, its best to have your tests done the same way, and usually in the same lab.  This allows your provider to compare your results over time. If you have questions about how your tests are done, ask your provider.1References Kankanala VL, Mukkamalla SKR. Carcinoembryonic Antigen. [Updated 2022 Jan 26; cited 2022 Dec 1].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw3988 Celiac Disease Screening : 1What is a celiac disease blood test? A celiac disease blood test looks for signs of celiac disease in a sample of your blood. Celiac disease is a chronic (long-term) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition, anemia and other serious health problems. Celiac disease is a type of autoimmune disease. That means that your own immune system attacks healthy cells in your body. Normally, your immune system makes proteins called antibodies to fight germs. With celiac disease, problems start if you eat foods that have a protein called gluten. Your immune system "thinks" the gluten proteins are germs, so it makes antibodies that attack the lining of your small intestine. Gluten is found in wheat, barley, rye, and some other grains. It's also found in certain toothpastes, lipsticks, medicines, and other products.  A celiac disease test looks for antibodies to gluten in your blood sample. Other names: celiac disease antibody test, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG), deaminated gliadin peptide antibodies, anti-endometrial antibodies1What is it used for? A celiac disease blood test is used to: Help diagnose celiac disease if you have symptoms Monitor celiac disease to see if treatment is helping Screen for signs of celiac disease if the disease runs in your family (more than one person has it)1Why do I need a celiac disease blood test? You may need a celiac disease test if you have symptoms of celiac disease. Symptoms can vary a lot, and they may come and go. Children tend to have more digestive problems than adults. The digestive symptoms of celiac disease include: Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly) Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop) Constipation Gas Lactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestine Nausea and vomiting Pain in the abdomen (belly) Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in children Some people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as: Fatigue Headaches Depression and anxiety Irritability (in children) Itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults) Other conditions such as gluten sensitivity and wheat allergies may cause symptoms that are much like celiac disease. But these are different conditions. They don't damage the small intestine, and they are diagnosed with different tests. You may need a celiac test if you have a high risk for having the disease even if you don't have symptoms. Celiac disease is a genetic disorder. That means it's passed down from parents to children through genes. You are more likely to have celiac disease if you: Have a parent, sibling or child who has the disease Have another autoimmune disorder, such as type 1 diabetes Most people who have genes for celiac disease don't get the disease. But screening may still be important. That's because you could have intestinal damage from celiac disease even if you don't seem to notice any symptoms. This is called "silent celiac disease." Talk with your health care provider to see if you should be tested.1What happens during a celiac disease blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If the test is being used to diagnose celiac disease, you'll need to continue to eat foods with gluten for a few weeks before testing. Your health care provider will give you specific instructions about how to prepare for the test. If the test is being used to monitor celiac disease, you don't need any special preparations.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? There are different types of celiac disease antibodies, so your celiac blood test results may include information on more than one type of antibody. Your results may also include other blood tests you had to look for signs of celiac disease. Your provider can explain what all your test results say about your health. In general, results from a celiac disease blood test may be: Negative. This means that celiac disease antibodies weren't found in your blood. So, you probably don't have celiac disease. Positive. This mean that celiac disease antibodies were found in your blood. So, you're likely to have celiac disease. To confirm the diagnosis, you will need more tests to look for damage in your intestines. Uncertain, indeterminate, or inconclusive. These terms all mean that it's unclear whether you have celiac disease. Your provider may order other tests to confirm that you have celiac disease and/or to see how much damage the disease may have caused. These tests may include: A biopsy to examine a tissue sample from your small intestine or your skin if you have a rash that could be from celiac disease. An endoscopy is used to take a sample of tissue from your small intestine. Capsule endoscopy to look at your small intestine. For this test, you swallow a tiny camera in a capsule. As it passes through your small intestine, it records pictures. The camera leaves your body during a bowel movement (poop). Genetic testing to see if you have a gene linked to celiac disease Tests for other health problems that celiac disease may cause such as anemia, osteoporosis, or a lack of certain vitamins. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a celiac disease test? Most people with celiac disease will feel better if they avoid foods and products with gluten. Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. Eating a gluten-free diet usually helps heals damage in the small intestine and prevents more damage. Many people see symptoms improve within days to weeks of starting the diet.1References Celiac Disease Foundation [Internet]. Woodland Hills (CA): Celiac Disease Foundation; c1998–2022.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless, watery fluid that flows in and around your brain and spinal cord. Your brain and spinal cord make up your central nervous system. It controls and coordinates everything you do, including your ability to move, breathe, see think, and more. Cerebrospinal fluid acts like a cushion that helps protect your brain and spinal cord from sudden impact or injury. The fluid also removes waste products from the brain and helps your central nervous system work properly. A CSF analysis is a group of tests that use a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid to help diagnose diseases of the brain and spinal cord and other conditions that affect the central nervous system. Other names: Spinal Fluid Analysis, CSF Analysis1What is it used for? A CSF analysis is used to measure different substances in your cerebrospinal fluid. It may include tests to diagnose: Infectious diseases of the brain and spinal cord, including meningitis and encephalitis. CSF tests for infections look at white blood cells, bacteria, and other substances in the cerebrospinal fluid Autoimmune disorders, such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome and multiple sclerosis (MS). CSF tests for these disorders look for high levels of certain proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid. Bleeding in the brain Brain tumors, including from cancers in other parts of the body that may spread to the central nervous system Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, which includes memory loss, confusion, and changes in behavior1Why do I need a CSF analysis? Your health care provider may order a CSF analysis if you have: Symptoms of an infection or bleeding in the brain or spinal cord Symptoms of an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) Had a brain injury or an injury to your spinal cord Have cancer that may have spread to your central nervous system Symptoms that may be from another central nervous system condition, such as headaches Symptoms of a brain or spinal cord infection include: Fever Severe headache Seizures Stiff neck Nausea and vomiting Sensitivity to light Double vision Changes in behavior Confusion Symptoms of MS often vary and come and go, or they may steadily get worse. They may include: Blurred or double vision Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, body, or face Painful muscle spasms Weak muscles, often in the hands and legs Dizziness, balance problems, or clumsy movement when walking Bladder control problems Fatigue Problems thinking or learning new things1What happens during a CSF analysis? To get a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. During the procedure: You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table. A provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection. When the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine. Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes. You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn. Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a CSF analysis, but you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back at the site where the needle was inserted. You may also have some bleeding at the site or get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more, but your provider may suggest treatment to help relieve the pain.1What do the results mean? A CSF analysis may include a variety of different tests on your sample. So, the measurements on your test results will depend on which tests were done. Your provider can explain what your results mean. In general, your CSF analysis results may show that you have an infection, an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), or another disease or injury of the brain or spinal cord. Your provider will likely order more tests to confirm your diagnosis. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CSF analysis? Some infections, such as meningitis caused by bacteria, are life-threatening emergencies. If your provider suspects you have bacterial meningitis or another serious infection, you may need to start medicine before you have a final diagnosis.1References Allina Health [Internet].

This test measures the amount of ceruloplasmin in your blood. Ceruloplasmin is a protein that is made in the liver. It stores and carries copper from the liver into the bloodstream and to the parts of your body that need it. Copper is a mineral that is found in several foods, including nuts, chocolate, mushrooms, shellfish, and liver. It is important to many body functions, including building strong bones, producing energy, and making melanin (the substance that gives skin its color). But if you have too much or too little copper in your blood, it can be a sign of a serious health problem. Other names: CP, ceruloplasmin blood test, ceruloplasmin, serum1What is it used for? A ceruloplasmin test is most often used, along with copper testing, to help diagnose Wilson disease. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from removing excess copper. It can cause a dangerous buildup of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs. It may also be used to diagnose disorders that cause a copper deficiency (too little copper). These include: Malnutrition, a condition where you are not getting enough nutrients in your diet Malabsorption, a condition that makes it hard for your body to absorb and use the nutrients you eat Menkes syndrome, a rare, incurable genetic disease In addition, the test is sometimes used to diagnose liver disease.1Why do I need a ceruloplasmin test? Your health care provider may order a ceruloplasmin test if you have symptoms of Wilson disease. These include: Anemia Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) Nausea Abdominal pain Trouble swallowing and/or speaking Tremors Trouble walking Changes in behavior You may also need this test if you have a family history of Wilson disease, even if you don't have symptoms. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 5 and 35, but can show up earlier or later in life. You may also have this test if you have symptoms of a copper deficiency (too little copper). These include: Pale skin Abnormally low levels of white blood cells Osteoporosis, a condition that causes weakening of bones and makes them prone to fractures Fatigue Tingling in hands and feet Your baby may need this test if he or she has symptoms of Menkes syndrome. Symptoms usually show up in infancy and include: Hair that is brittle, sparse, and/or tangled Feeding difficulties Failure to grow Developmental delays Lack of muscle tone Seizures Most children with this syndrome die within the first few years of life, but treatment given in early infancy (within about 28 days after birth) may help some children live longer.1What happens during a ceruloplasmin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a ceruloplasmin test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A lower than normal level of ceruloplasmin may mean your body is not able to use or eliminate copper properly. It can be a sign of: Wilson disease Menkes syndrome Liver disease Malnutrition Malabsorption Kidney disease If your ceruloplasmin levels were higher than normal, it may be a sign of: A serious infection Heart disease Rheumatoid arthritis Leukemia Hodgkin lymphoma But high levels of ceruloplasmin may also be due to conditions that don't need medical treatment. These include pregnancy and the use of birth control pills. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a ceruloplasmin test? Ceruloplasmin tests are often done along with other tests. These include copper tests in blood and/or urine and liver function tests.1References Biology Dictionary [Internet].

These tests check to see if you are or have ever been infected with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). This virus causes chickenpox and shingles. When you are first infected with VZV, you get chickenpox. Once you get chickenpox, you can't get it again. The virus remains in your nervous system but is dormant (inactive). Later in life, VZV can become active and can cause shingles. Unlike chicken pox, you can get shingles more than once, but it is rare. Both chickenpox and shingles cause blistering skin rashes. Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease that causes red, itchy sores (pox) all over the body. It used to be a very common childhood disease, infecting nearly all children in the United States. But since a chickenpox vaccine was introduced in 1995, there have been far fewer cases. Chickenpox may be uncomfortable, but it's usually a mild illness in healthy children. But it can be serious for adults, pregnant women, newborns, and people with weakened immune systems. Shingles is a disease that only affects people who once had chickenpox. It causes a painful, burning rash that may stay in one part of the body or spread to many parts of the body. Nearly one-third of people in the United States will get shingles at some point in their lifetime, most often after the age of 50. Most people who develop shingles recover in three to five weeks, but it sometimes causes long-term pain and other health problems. Other names: varicella zoster virus antibody, serum varicella immunoglobulin G antibody level, VZV antibodies IgG and IgM, herpes zoster1What are they used for? Health care providers can usually diagnose chickenpox or shingles with a visual examination. Tests are sometimes ordered to check for immunity to the varicella zoster virus (VZV). You have immunity if you've had chickenpox before or have had the chickenpox vaccine. If you have immunity it means you can't get chickenpox, but you can still get shingles later in life. Tests may be done on people who don't have or are unsure about immunity and are at higher risk of complications from VZV. These include: Pregnant women Newborns, if the mother is infected Teen and adults with symptoms of chickenpox People with HIV/AIDS or another condition that weakens the immune system1Why do I need a chickenpox or shingles test? You may need a chickenpox or shingles test if you are at risk for complications, are not immune to VZV, and/or have symptoms of infection. Symptoms of the two diseases are similar and include: Red, blistering rash. Chickenpox rashes often appear all over the body and are usually very itchy. Shingles sometimes appear in just one area and are often painful. Fever Headache Sore throat You may also need this test if you are in a high-risk group and were recently exposed to chickenpox or shingles. You can't catch shingles from another person. But the shingles virus (VZV) can be spread and cause chickenpox in someone who doesn't have immunity.1What happens during chickenpox and shingles testing? You will need to provide a sample of blood from your vein or from the fluid in one of your blisters. Blood tests check for antibodies to the VZV. Blister tests check for the virus itself. For a blood test from a vein, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. For a blister test, a health care provider will gently press a cotton swab on a blister to collect a sample of fluid for testing. Both types of tests are quick, usually taking less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for a blood or blister test.1Are there any risks to the test? After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a blister test.1What do the results mean? If you have symptoms and results show VZV antibodies or the virus itself, it's likely you have chickenpox or shingles. Your diagnosis of either chickenpox or shingles will depend on your age and specific symptoms. If your results show antibodies or the virus itself and you don't have symptoms, you either once had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. If you are diagnosed with an infection and are in a high-risk group, your health care provider may prescribe antiviral medicines. Early treatment can prevent serious and painful complications. Most healthy children and adults with chickenpox will recover from chickenpox within a week or two. Home treatment can help relieve symptoms. More serious cases may be treated with antiviral medicines. Shingles may also be treated with antiviral medicines as well as pain relievers. If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about chickenpox and shingles tests? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the chickenpox vaccine for children, teens, and adults who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. Some schools require this vaccine for admittance. Check with your child's school and your child's health care provider for more information. The CDC also recommends that healthy adults age 50 and older get two doses of the shingles vaccine called Shingrix, separated by 2 to 6 months. The vaccine provides strong protection against shingles and complications from the disease. You should get the vaccine even if you’ve already had shingles, as it may prevent future outbreaks. A different shingles vaccine called Zostavax is no longer available in the United States. If you had a Zostavax vaccine in the past, you should still get vaccinated with Shingrix. Talk to your health care provider about the best time get Shingrix. 1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

 Chlamydia Test : 1What is a Chlamydia Test? Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is a bacterial infection spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex with someone who has the infection. A chlamydia test looks for chlamydia bacteria in a sample of fluid from your body. The sample may be: Urine (pee) Fluid that's usually swabbed from the:

Urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body)
Vagina
Rectum (the last part of your intestine that connects to the anus).

 Urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) Vagina Rectum (the last part of your intestine that connects to the anus). Chlamydia often has no symptoms, so you may spread the disease without even knowing you have the infection. If a pregnant person has chlamydia, they can give the infection to their baby during childbirth. The disease is easily treated with antibiotic medicine. But if it's not treated, it can cause serious complications. The infection can spread in the female reproductive system and cause infertility. It can also lead to reactive arthritis (uncommon). A chlamydia test can diagnose the disease so you can get treatment before you develop lasting health problems or spread the disease to others. Other names: Chlamydia NAAT or NAT, Chlamydia/GC STD Panel1What is it used for? A chlamydia test is used to find out whether or not you have a chlamydia infection. The test is also done three months after treatment for chlamydia to check for re-infection.1Why do I need a chlamydia test? Chlamydia is a very common STD, especially in sexually active people ages 15 to 24.  But chlamydia usually doesn't cause symptoms, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations recommend regular screening tests if your risk of getting chlamydia is high. If you are a woman or a transgender or gender diverse person with a cervix (lower part of the uterus), you should: Get tested for chlamydia at least once a year if you are:

Younger than 25 and having sex
Age 25 or older and have a higher risk of getting chlamydia because you:

Have a new sex partner or more than one partner
Have a sex partner who is having sex with others
Have a sex partner with an STD
Don't use condoms correctly every time



 Younger than 25 and having sex Age 25 or older and have a higher risk of getting chlamydia because you:

Have a new sex partner or more than one partner
Have a sex partner who is having sex with others
Have a sex partner with an STD
Don't use condoms correctly every time

 Have a new sex partner or more than one partner Have a sex partner who is having sex with others Have a sex partner with an STD Don't use condoms correctly every time Get tested for chlamydia if you are pregnant. Regular chlamydia testing at least once a year is also recommended if you: Have HIV. Are a man who has sex with men (MSM) or a transgender diverse person with a penis who has sex with men.  Test every 3 to 6 months if you or your partner have sex with more than one person, or if you have other sexual behaviors that may increase your risk for getting chlamydia. The best testing schedule for you may be different than the recommendations. Ask your provider how often you should get tested. Your provider will order a test if your sex partner has been diagnosed with chlamydia or if you have symptoms. Symptoms of chlamydia may include: An unusual discharge (fluid) from your genitals (penis or vagina) or rectum Irritation or itching around your genitals Pain or burning when you urinate (pee) Rectal pain or bleeding if chlamydia infects the rectum1What happens during a chlamydia test? To do a chlamydia test, you will need to provide a sample of fluid from the part of your body that may be infected. There are two ways to gather the sample: A first-catch urine sample. You use a sterile cup to a collect urine from the very first part of your urine stream. To get an accurate test result, you will need to stop urinating for two hours before the test. A swab sample. Your provider will use a special swab or brush to gather cells, usually from the genital area (the urethra or the vagina). This may cause some brief discomfort. In certain cases, the rectum, cervix, throat, or eyes may be swabbed. Your provider may give you the option to swab yourself following special instructions. Test results are usually ready in a day. There are some rapid chlamydia tests that can provide results in 90 minutes or less. You can also buy at-home collection kits to test for chlamydia and other STDs. With these kits, you collect a swab or urine sample at home and send it to a lab for testing. It's important to follow all the instructions carefully. You should not use an at-home test if you have symptoms of chlamydia or if your partner has chlamydia. In that case, it's important to talk with your provider right away so you don't delay treatment. Ask your provider whether at-home chlamydia testing is right for you.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Preparations for a chlamydia test depend on the type of sample you will be providing. You may need to avoid antibiotic medicines and vaginal douches or creams for 24 hours before your test. Ask your provider if there are any special instructions for your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a chlamydia test.1What do the results mean? A negative test result means that you did not have a chlamydia infection when the sample was collected. A positive test result means you have been infected with chlamydia. If your test result is positive, you will need antibiotics to treat your infection. Your provider will give you instructions on how to take your medicine. To make sure your infection is cured, follow the instructions carefully and finish all the medicine. You will also need to let your sexual partner/s know you tested positive for chlamydia so that they can be tested and treated if necessary. Three months after you finish treatment, you will need to be tested for chlamydia again to check for a new infection. That's because repeat infections are very common. Ask your provider to tell you how often to get tested after that. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a chlamydia test? Chlamydia testing can help you avoid lasting health problems and stop the spread of this disease. You can also take steps to protect yourself from getting chlamydia. The most reliable way to prevent chlamydia or any STD is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection by: Having sex with only one partner who has tested negative for STDs and who has sex only with you (mutual monogamy) Using condoms correctly every time you have sex1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

A chloride blood test measures the amount of chloride in your blood. Chloride is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body.  Chloride is often measured with other electrolytes to diagnose or monitor conditions, such as kidney disease, heart failure, liver disease, and high blood pressure. Other names: CI, Serum chloride1What is it used for? You usually get a chloride test as part of a routine blood screening to check your general health. It's also used to help diagnose conditions related to an imbalance of acids or fluids in your body.1Why do I need a chloride blood test? Your health care provider may have ordered a chloride blood test as part of an electrolyte panel, which is a routine blood test. An electrolyte panel is a test that measures chloride and other electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate. You may also need a chloride blood test if you have symptoms of an acid or fluid imbalance, including: Vomiting over a long period of time Diarrhea Fatigue Weakness Dehydration Trouble breathing1What happens during a chloride blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a chloride blood test or an electrolyte panel. If your provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? There are many reasons why your chloride levels may not be in the normal range. High levels of chloride may be a sign of: Dehydration Kidney disease Metabolic acidosis, a condition in which you have too much acid in your blood. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Low levels of chloride may be a sign of: Heart failure Lung disease Addison disease, a condition in which your body's adrenal glands don't produce enough of certain types of hormones. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, dizziness, weight loss, and dehydration. Metabolic alkalosis, a condition in which you have too much base in your blood. It can cause irritability, muscle twitching, and tingling in the fingers and toes. If your chloride levels are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Many things can affect your chloride levels, such as drinking too much fluid or losing fluid because of vomiting or diarrhea. Also, certain medicines such as antacids can cause abnormal results. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a chloride blood test? Urine also contains some chloride. Your provider may also recommend a urine chloride test to get more information about your chloride levels.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&ContentID=chloride Cholesterol Levels : 1What is a Cholesterol Test? A cholesterol test is a blood test that measures the amount of cholesterol and certain fats in your blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in your blood and every cell of your body. You need some cholesterol to keep your cells and organs healthy. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs. But you can also get cholesterol from the foods you eat, especially meat, eggs, poultry, and dairy products. Foods that are high in dietary fat can also make your liver produce more cholesterol. There are two main types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good" cholesterol. Too much LDL cholesterol in your blood increases your risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases. High LDL levels can cause the buildup of a sticky substance called plaque in your arteries. Over time, plaque can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, parts of your body don't get enough blood: If the blood flow to the heart is blocked, it can cause a heart attack. If the blood flow to the brain is blocked, it can cause a stroke. If the blood flow to the arms or legs is blocked, it can cause peripheral artery disease. Other names for a cholesterol test: Lipid profile, Lipid panel1What is it used for? A cholesterol test gives you and your health care provider important information about your risk of developing heart disease. If your test shows you have high cholesterol, you can take steps to lower it. This may decrease your risk of developing heart problems in the future. A cholesterol test measures: LDL levels. Also known as the "bad" cholesterol, LDL is the main source of blockages in the arteries. HDL levels. Considered the "good" cholesterol, HDL helps get rid of "bad" LDL cholesterol. Total cholesterol. The combined amount of LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol in your blood. Triglyceride levels. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Some studies show that high levels of triglycerides may increase the risk of heart disease, especially in women. VLDL levels. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is another type of "bad" cholesterol. High VLDL levels have been linked to plaque buildup in the arteries. VLDL isn't usually included in routine cholesterol tests because it's difficult to measure. About half of VLDL is triglycerides, so your VLDL level can be estimated as a percentage of your triglyceride level.1Why do I need a cholesterol test? Your provider may order a cholesterol test as part of a routine exam. You may also have a cholesterol test if you have a family history of heart disease or if your risk for heart problems is high because of: High blood pressure Type 2 diabetes Smoking Excess weight or obesity Lack of physical activity A diet high in saturated fat Your age may also be a factor, because your risk for heart disease increases as you get older.1What happens during a cholesterol test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. You may be able to use an at-home kit to check your cholesterol levels. Your kit will include a device to prick your finger to collect a drop of blood for testing. Be sure to follow the kit instructions carefully. Also, be sure to tell your provider if your at-home test shows that your total cholesterol level is higher than 200 mg/dl.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 9 to 12 hours before your blood cholesterol test. That's why the tests are often done in the morning. Your provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any other special instructions.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Cholesterol is usually measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. The information below will help you understand what your test results mean. In general, low LDL levels and high HDL cholesterol levels are good for heart health. 

 

 

 The LDL listed on your results may say "calculated." This means that your LDL level is an estimate based on your total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. Your LDL level may also be measured "directly" from your blood sample. Either way, you want your LDL number to be low. A healthy cholesterol level for you may depend on your age, family history, lifestyle, and other risk factors for heart disease, such as high triglyceride levels. Your provider can explain what's right for you. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about my cholesterol levels? High cholesterol can lead to heart disease, the number one cause of death in the United States. You can't change some risk factors for high cholesterol, such as age and your genes. But there are actions you can take to lower your LDL levels and reduce your risk, including: Eating a healthy diet. Reducing or avoiding foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol can help reduce the cholesterol levels in your blood. Losing weight. Being overweight can increase your cholesterol and risk for heart disease. Staying active. Regular exercise may help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol levels. It may also help you lose weight. Talk to your provider before making any major change in your diet or exercise routine.1References American Heart Association [Internet]. Dallas (TX): American Heart Association Inc.; c2022.

Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is test for pregnant women that checks chorionic villi, tiny finger-like growths found in the placenta. The placenta is the organ that nourishes an unborn baby in the uterus. The test looks for abnormalities in the baby's chromosomes. Chromosomes are parts of cells that contain your genes. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. Normally, people have a total of 46 chromosomes. Chorionic villi contain the same chromosomes as an unborn baby. So, a CVS test can show if a baby has an extra chromosome or a missing or damaged chromosome. These chromosome differences can cause serious health problems. CVS is a prenatal diagnostic test, which means it can almost always tell for sure whether an unborn baby has a chromosome disorder. This is different than a prenatal screening test, which only shows whether a baby has an increased risk of a serious health problem. Other names: CVS test1What is it used for? CVS testing is used to diagnose chromosome problems or other genetic diseases in an unborn baby. These include: Down syndrome, a disorder that causes intellectual disabilities, certain physical features, and various health problems. Cystic fibrosis, a disease that causes mucus buildup in the lungs and other organs, making it hard to breathe. Sickle cell disease, a disorder of the red blood cells. It can cause pain, infections, organ damage, and strokes. Tay-Sachs disease, a disorder that causes fatty proteins to build up in the brain. It affects sight, hearing, and mental development. Most children with Tay-Sachs die by the age of 5. CVS testing is very accurate and can be done early in pregnancy, between the 10th and 13th week. But it can only diagnose certain genetic diseases. A CVS test does not diagnose or screen for birth defects such as neural tube defects, conditions that cause abnormal development of a developing baby's brain and/or spine. Different tests, including an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood test, are used to screen for or diagnose these and other birth defects.1Why do I need a CVS test? You may need CVS testing if you are at higher risk for having a baby with a chromosome disorder. Risk factors include: Age. Women age 35 and older have a higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome or another genetic disorder. Family history of a genetic disorder Having another child with a genetic disorder You may also need CVS testing if you had abnormal results on a prenatal screening test.1What happens during a CVS test? There are two types of CVS tests: Transabdominal The sample is taken through the abdomen. Transcervical. The sample is taken through the cervix. The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina. Your provider will use an ultrasound to check your baby's position and guide the procedure (transabdominal or transcervical). Ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures. During a transabdominal CVS, your provider will: Clean your abdomen with an antiseptic. Apply a numbing medicine to your abdomen. Insert a long, thin needle through your abdomen and uterus and into the placenta. You may feel a cramping or stinging sensation as the needle enters the uterus. Use the needle to withdraw a sample of tissue from the placenta. Remove the needle. During a transcervical CVS, your provider will: Clean your vagina and cervix with an antiseptic Use an instrument called a speculum to gently spread apart the sides of your vagina. Insert a thin tube through your vagina and cervix and up to the placenta. You may feel a slight twinge or cramping as this is done. Use the tube to gently suck in a sample of tissue from the placenta. Remove the tube.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? On the morning of the test, you may be asked to drink extra fluids and not urinate. This will fill your bladder, which may help move the uterus into a better position for the procedure.1Are there any risks to the test? CVS is generally considered to be a safe procedure, but it does have some risks. These include: Miscarriage, which happens in about one in every hundred procedures Infection Bleeding Rh sensitization. This is a condition in which your body makes antibodies (proteins made by the immune system) that attack your baby's red blood cells. If diagnosed during pregnancy, it is easily treatable. Limb defects in the baby (this is very rare)1What do the results mean? CVS test results are usually available within two weeks. If your results were not normal, it may mean your baby has a chromosome or genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis. Occasionally, CVS test results are unclear, and your provider may recommend amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is another prenatal diagnostic test. It is performed between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about CVS testing? Some chromosome and genetic disorders require your baby to have extensive medical treatments. Other disorders may not be treatable. If your CVS test results were not normal, you should talk with your health care provider about your options and the decisions you may need to make.  It may also help to speak to a genetic counselor both before and after you get your results. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and can help you understand what your results mean.1References American Pregnancy Association [Internet].

This test measures the amount of chymotrypsin in a stool sample. Chymotrypsin is an enzyme released by the pancreas during digestion. If lower than normal amounts are released, it may mean your pancreas isn't making enough enzymes to digest your food properly. This is known as pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency is most often caused by chronic pancreatitis, a swelling of the pancreas. It may also be caused by cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs, including the pancreas. People with CF often have trouble absorbing nutrients from food. Your sample may also be tested for trypsin, an enzyme released by the pancreas along with chymotrypsin. Other names: fecal chymotrypsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin stool test1What is it used for? A chymotrypsin in stool test is used to help diagnose conditions that affect the pancreas, such as: Pancreatitis Cystic fibrosis Malnutrition, a condition in which your body does not get the calories, vitamins, and/or minerals needed for good health1Why do I need a chymotrypsin in stool test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder. These include: Chronic diarrhea Abdominal pain Foul-smelling, greasy stools Weight loss Frequent sinus infections1What happens during a chymotrypsin in stool test? You will need to provide a stool sample. Your health care provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following: Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves. Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab. You may get a device or applicator to help you collect the sample. Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample. Seal and label the container. Remove the gloves, and wash your hands. Return the container to your health care provider or the lab by mail or in person.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You don't need any special preparations for a chymotrypsin in stool test.1Are there any risks to this test? There is no known risk to having a stool test.1What do the results mean? Your results will show whether the amount of chymotrypsin in your stool is normal or below normal. Your results may also include the amount of trypsin found. If the amount of chymotrypsin and/or trypsin is below normal, it may mean your pancreas isn't making enough enzymes to digest your food properly. But the test can't diagnose any specific disorders by itself. Your health care provider will need to order more tests. These may include the following, which measure different pancreatic enzymes: Stool elastase Lipase blood test Amylase blood test If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

Coagulation factors are proteins in your blood. They help form blood clots to stop bleeding when you have an injury. These proteins are also called clotting factors. You have several different types of clotting factors that are all important for making blood clots. Coagulation factor tests are blood tests that check one or more of your clotting factors to see if you: Have too much or too little of a clotting factor Are missing a clotting factor Have a clotting factor that isn't working properly Your liver makes most of your clotting factors. But normally, clotting factors are turned off, so you don't form abnormal blood clots. When you have an injury that causes bleeding, blood cells called platelets begin to make a soft blood clot to stop the bleeding. The platelets release molecules into your blood that begin to turn on the clotting factors. The clotting factors work together in a chain reaction to form a harder blood clot that will stay firmly in place. Problems with any one of your clotting factors may mean that: Your blood clots too easily, even without an injury. This condition may lead to clots that block your blood flow and cause serious conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, or clots in the lungs. Your blood doesn't clot enough after an injury or surgery. If this happens, you have a bleeding disorder. Bleeding disorders can lead to serious blood loss after an injury. Clotting factors have names, such as fibrinogen and prothrombin. Each clotting factor also has a Roman numeral name, such as "clotting factor II." Other names: blood clotting factors, factor assays, factor assay by number (Factor I, Factor II, Factor VIII, etc.) or by name (fibrinogen, prothrombin, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, etc.), coagulation panel1What is it used for? A coagulation factor test is used to find out if you have a problem with any of your clotting factors that may cause too little or too much blood clotting. Coagulation factor tests are also used to monitor people who have a known problem with clotting factors or who take medicine called blood thinners to lower the risk of blood clots. You may have tests for one or more factors at a time.1Why do I need a coagulation factor test? You may need this test if you have: An abnormal result on a blood test that checks how long it takes your blood to clot. These tests include a prothrombin time test and INR (PT/INR) and/or a partial thromboplastin time test (PTT). A family health history of problems with clotting factors. Some conditions that affect clotting factors, such hemophilia, are inherited. That means that your parents passed the gene for the disease to you. These conditions are not common. 
A health condition that may affect clotting factors in your blood:
Conditions that may cause a bleeding disorder include:

Severe liver disease
A lack of vitamin K
Blood transfusions
Cancer
Immune disorders

Conditions that may cause a problem with blood clots include:

Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus
Cancer
Obesity
Certain infections, such as sepsis and COVID-19
Not moving for long periods of time, such as after surgery
Lack of vitamins B6, B12, and folate

 A health condition that may affect clotting factors in your blood: Conditions that may cause a bleeding disorder include: Severe liver disease A lack of vitamin K Blood transfusions Cancer Immune disorders Conditions that may cause a problem with blood clots include: Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus Cancer Obesity Certain infections, such as sepsis and COVID-19 Not moving for long periods of time, such as after surgery Lack of vitamins B6, B12, and folate Symptoms that may be from a problem with clotting factors:
Symptoms of bleeding disorders may include:

Heavy bleeding that doesn't stop with pressure after an injury, dental procedure, or surgery
Frequent nosebleeds that start on their own
Blood in urine (pee) or stool (poop)
Frequent, large bruises or tiny red or brown spots under the skin
Redness, swelling, pain, or stiffness from bleeding into muscles or joints
Heavy menstrual periods

Symptoms of too much blood clotting may include:

Swelling, redness, warmth, and pain in your arms or legs which may be from a clot
Trouble breathing from a clot that's traveled to your lung
Nausea

 Symptoms that may be from a problem with clotting factors: Symptoms of bleeding disorders may include: Heavy bleeding that doesn't stop with pressure after an injury, dental procedure, or surgery Frequent nosebleeds that start on their own Blood in urine (pee) or stool (poop) Frequent, large bruises or tiny red or brown spots under the skin Redness, swelling, pain, or stiffness from bleeding into muscles or joints Heavy menstrual periods Symptoms of too much blood clotting may include: Swelling, redness, warmth, and pain in your arms or legs which may be from a clot Trouble breathing from a clot that's traveled to your lung Nausea1What happens during a coagulation factor test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a coagulation factor test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider may need to order other tests to diagnose the cause of a problem with your clotting factors. Lower than normal levels of one or more clotting factors or a missing clotting factor may mean you have a bleeding disorder. Depending on which clotting factors were tested, your results may show the type of bleeding disorder you have and how serious it is. Bleeding disorders that you inherit usually involve only one clotting factor. There is no cure for inherited bleeding disorders, but treatment can help manage your condition. Bleeding disorders caused by other conditions usually involve low levels of two or more clotting factors. Treatment depends on the cause of your bleeding disorder. Higher than normal levels of one or more clotting factors may mean you have a disorder that makes your blood clot more than it should. Your provider may recommend medicine and heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help prevent clots. You may also need to avoid hormone replacement therapy for menopause and birth control pills with estrogen, because they may increase the risk of blood clots. Talk with your provider to find out what your tests results mean and what treatment is best for you. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References American Heart Association [Internet]. Dallas: American Heart Association Inc.; c2022.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538251/ Cognitive Testing : 1What is cognitive testing? Cognitive testing checks for problems with certain brain functions called "cognition." Cognition includes thinking, learning, remembering, and using judgment and language. Problems with cognition are called "cognitive impairment." There are many different cognitive tests that check for cognitive impairment. They generally involve answering questions and doing simple tasks, such as repeating lists of words or spelling words backwards. The most commonly used tests usually take 15 minutes or less. Cognitive impairment is more common among older people, but it's not a normal part of aging. It can be caused by many medical and mental health conditions. Some of these conditions may be treatable, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), depression, and side effects from medicine. Treating these conditions may improve cognitive impairment or cure it completely. But cognitive impairment caused by dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, has no cure and gets worse over time. Cognitive testing alone can't diagnose dementia or any other cause of cognitive impairment. But the test results can show whether you have a problem with how your brain is functioning that needs more testing. That helps your health care provider order the right tests to learn more about your cognitive impairment and whether it can be treated. Even if the cause of cognitive impairment can't be treated, the information you gain from cognitive testing can help you and your family plan for your future care. Other names: cognitive assessment, cognitive screening, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA test, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Mini-Cog1What is it used for? Cognitive testing is used if a person shows signs of a problem with memory, thinking, or other brain functions. The test show if a person has a problem that requires more testing. Cognitive testing is often used to screen older adults for a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI may notice that they have more trouble with memory than other people their age. They may lose things more often or have more trouble coming up with words for what they want to say.  But they're still able to do their usual daily activities. There's no cure for MCI. If you have the condition, your provider may give you cognitive tests as part of your routine checkup to see if your brain function has changed. That's because researchers have found that people with MCI have a higher risk of developing dementia than those without MCI. But in many cases, the symptoms of MCI stay the same or even improve over time.1Why do I need cognitive testing? You may need cognitive testing if you show signs of cognitive impairment. You may notice these changes yourself or your family or friends may notice them. Signs of cognitive impairment include: Forgetting appointments and important events Losing things often Having trouble coming up with words that you usually know Losing your train of thought in conversations, movies, or books Feeling increased irritability and/or anxiety1What happens during a cognitive test? There are different types of cognitive tests. They all involve answering questions and usually doing some simple tasks. Commonly used tests include: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. This test takes about 15 minutes. It includes memorizing a short list of words, copying a drawing of a shape or object, and looking at pictures of animals and saying which animals you see. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). This test takes about 10 minutes. It includes knowing what date it is, counting backward, and identifying everyday objects, such as a pencil or watch Mini-Cog. This test usually takes about 3 minutes. It includes recalling a three-word list of objects and drawing a clock with hands that shows a specific time.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for cognitive testing? You don't need any special preparations for a cognitive test.1Are there any risks to testing?  There is no risk to having cognitive testing.1What do the results mean? Your cognitive test result will be a score.  If your test score is normal, you could still have some cognitive impairment that the test may not show. If you or your family are concerned about your brain function, but your test results were normal, talk with your provider about having another type of cognitive test. If your score is lower than normal, it usually means you have some level of cognitive impairment. But your provider can't make a diagnosis on these test results alone. Depending on your score, your provider may have you see a neurologist (a doctor with special training diagnosing and treating problems with the brain and nervous system). The neurologist may do longer tests called "neuropsychological testing" to learn more about how your brain is working. These detailed tests check your ability to plan, solve problems, and make decisions. Your provider may also order tests to confirm or rule out treatable conditions that could be causing cognitive impairment. Which tests you have will depend on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results of cognitive testing. You may be tested for treatable conditions such as: Blood vessel disorders Sleep disorders Hypothyroidism Lack of certain vitamins, such as vitamin B12, or minerals Mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or stress Concussion or other head injury from an accident or fall Stroke Urinary tract infection (UTI) If you have cognitive impairment that can't be cured, medicines and healthy lifestyle changes may help slow the loss of brain function over time. If you have questions or are concerned about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about cognitive testing? You may have heard about cognitive tests that you can take yourself online. If you or someone you know is concerned about cognitive impairment, doing one of these tests may be helpful. But it's important to follow up with your provider to discuss the test results and any other tests you may need to properly diagnose your condition.1References Alzheimer's Association [Internet].

A cold stimulation test involves placing your fingers in an ice water bath to find out if you have Raynaud's syndrome. Raynaud's syndrome, also known as Raynaud's disease or Raynaud's phenomenon, is a condition that causes brief episodes where little or no blood flows to certain parts of your body after exposure to cold or sometimes stress. It mostly affects fingers and/or toes. A Raynaud's episode can be triggered by very mild and limited exposure to cold, such as taking food out of the freezer or holding a cold drink. When an episode happens, your skin may feel cold and numb. It may also make your skin turn white or blue. As blood flow returns, your skin may tingle, throb, or turn red. It usually takes about 15 minutes for normal blood flow to return. There are two forms of Raynaud's syndrome: Primary Raynaud's, a fairly common and mild condition. It is not associated with any other health problem. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 15 and 25. Most people with primary Raynaud's syndrome can manage their symptoms without medical treatment. Secondary Raynaud's, often referred to as Raynaud's phenomenon, is less common than primary Raynaud's but more serious. Symptoms may include skin ulcers (open sores caused by poor blood flow) or skin infections. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 35 and 40. Secondary Raynaud's is most often caused by another medical condition. These include immune system disorders and connective tissue diseases. Connective tissue diseases affect blood flow to tissues and organs. Other names: cold challenge test1What is it used for? A cold stimulation test is used to diagnose Raynaud's syndrome.1Why do I need a cold stimulation test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of Raynaud's syndrome. Symptoms usually show up after exposure to cold. They mostly affect fingers and toes and include: Skin that turns white or blue Skin that is numb and painful Skin that takes a long time to warm up after exposure1What happens during a cold stimulation test?  A small device that measures temperature will be taped to your fingers. Your provider will record the temperature. You will then place your hands into an ice water bath for 20 seconds. You will remove your hands from the ice water. Your provider will record your finger temperature every five minutes for up to 20 minutes, or until your temperature returns to the same as it was before the ice water bath.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a cold stimulation test.1Are there any risks to the test? You may feel some discomfort while your hands are in the ice water.1What do the results mean? If it takes 20 minutes or more for your finger temperature to return to normal after the ice water bath, it probably means you have Raynaud's syndrome. If your symptoms are severe and/or you are age 35 or older, you may have secondary Raynaud's syndrome. Secondary Raynaud's can be caused by several disorders, including: Scleroderma, a disease that causes hardening of the skin and other body tissues Sjögren's syndrome, a disorder that causes dryness of the eyes and mouth Lupus, an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple parts of the body, including the joints, blood vessels, kidneys, and brain Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints A blood disorder, such as polycythemia vera, a disease that causes your body to make too many red blood cells Pulmonary hypertension, a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in your lungs and heart If your provider thinks you have secondary Raynaud's syndrome, he or she may order more tests to help diagnose the disorder that is causing it. These tests include: Nailfold capillaroscopy. For this test, your provider will place a drop of oil on the base of one of your fingernails. The nail area is then examined under a microscope. If abnormal arteries are seen, it can be a sign of scleroderma or other connective tissue disease. Blood tests to check for immune system disorders. These include an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a cold stimulation test? There are steps you can take that may help you avoid or reduce the symptoms of Raynaud's syndrome, including: Dressing extra warmly for cold weather. This includes wearing a hat, mittens, scarf, and heavy socks. Using battery- or chemical-operated hand and/or foot warmers Turning down air conditioning and wearing a sweater or jacket when in an air-conditioned space Getting regular exercise, which increases blood flow Limiting caffeine and alcohol Avoiding stress These changes should be enough to manage the symptoms of primary Raynaud's syndrome. If your symptoms are causing too much discomfort, or if you have secondary Raynaud's syndrome, your provider may also prescribe medicines that can help open your blood vessels. 1References Arthritis Foundation [Internet].

Colorectal cancer screening tests check for signs of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum. The colon makes up most of the large intestine. The rectum is at the end of the large intestine and connects to the anus. Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Screening can help find colorectal cancer early, when treatment is most effective. Colorectal cancer screening can sometimes prevent cancer from even developing. That's because some types of screening tests let a health care provider find and remove abnormal growths, known as colorectal polyps. Most of these polyps are benign (not cancerous) but do have a risk of becoming cancerous if not removed. Other names: colon cancer screening1What are they used for? Colorectal cancer screening tests are used to check for signs of colorectal cancer and/or to remove colorectal polyps.1Why do I need a colorectal cancer screening test? The National Cancer Institute and other expert medical groups recommend people get regular screenings for colorectal cancer, starting at age 50. The American Cancer Society recommends that people begin screening at age 45. You should talk with your health care provider about when you should start and about the different types of screening tests. You may need to be screened at a younger age, or more often, if you have certain risk factors including: A family history of colorectal cancer Previously had colorectal polyps A family history of, or having had, ovarian cancer Inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease1What happens during a colorectal cancer screening? There are two main types of colorectal cancer screening tests: visual exams and stool tests. There are different options for both types of tests. Visual exams are procedures that allow a provider to look inside the colon and rectum. They are done either using a thin tube with a camera attached or with a special imaging device. Types of visual exams include: Colonoscopy. This test allows a provider to view your entire colon and rectum. It is often done in an outpatient department of a hospital or medical center. Before the test, you will need to empty out your colon (large bowel) in a procedure called bowel prep. During the test: You will lie on an exam table. You will be given medicine called a sedative to help you relax. It also prevents you from feeling pain during the procedure. You may be awake for the test, but you probably won't remember anything. A colonoscope, a thin, lighted tube with a camera attached, will be inserted into your rectum and up into your colon. Your provider will look for colorectal polyps or other abnormal areas. Your provider may remove polyps or tissue samples using special tools inserted through the scope. Polyps or samples may be sent to a lab for testing. The sedative you are given may make you drowsy for several hours. You should arrange for someone to drive you home. Sigmoidoscopy. This test allows your provider to look at the lower part of the colon. During the test: You will lie on an exam table with your knees drawn up to your chest. A sigmoidoscope, a flexible, lighted tube with a camera, will be inserted into the rectum and up into the lower part of the colon. Air will be pumped through the sigmoidoscope to make the colon bigger and easier to see. The air may make you feel like you need to have a bowel movement or pass gas. Your provider may remove polyps or tissue samples using special tools inserted through the scope. Polyps or samples may be sent to a lab for testing. Virtual Colonoscopy. This is a type of x-ray that uses a CT scan (computed tomography) to take detailed, 3-dimensional pictures of the entire colon and rectum. It is usually done in a radiology department of a hospital or medical center. This procedure also requires bowel prep beforehand. During the test: You will lie on a narrow table. You may be asked to drink a liquid containing contrast dye. Contrast dye is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray. A provider will insert a small tube into the rectum. Air will be pumped through the tube to make the colon bigger and easier to see. The table will slide into the CT machine. A series of images will be taken. Stool tests look at stool samples for signs of cancer. For these tests, you take a stool sample at home and send it to a lab. Types of stool tests: Fecal occult blood tests. These tests look for hidden (known as occult) blood in the stool. Blood in the stool may be a sign of polyps, cancer, or other conditions. Your health care provider will give you a kit that includes instructions on how to do the test. There are two types of fecal occult blood tests: the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the guaiac smear method (gFOBT). Below are typical instructions for each test. Your instructions may vary slightly depending on the manufacturer of the test kit. For a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), you will most likely need to: Collect samples from two or three separate bowel movements. Collect the sample from the toilet using the special brush or other device included in your kit. For each sample, use the brush or device to take the sample from the surface of the stool. Brush the sample onto a test card. Label and seal all your samples as directed. Mail the samples to your health care provider or lab. For a guaiac smear test (gFOBT), you will most likely need to: Collect samples from three separate bowel movements. For each sample, collect the stool and store it in a clean container. Make sure the sample does not mix in with urine or water from the toilet. Use the applicator from your test kit to smear some of the stool on the test card or slide, also included in your kit. Label and seal all your samples as directed. Mail the samples to your health care provider or lab. Stool DNA test. This test checks for genetic changes in the stool that may be signs of colorectal polyps or cancer. Your provider will let you know to get a test kit. The kit will include instructions on how to do the test. The instructions will likely include the following steps: Put a special container inside your toilet. Collect an entire bowel movement. Close and seal the container. Mail the container with the stool sample to a lab for testing.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? There are no special preparations needed for a FIT or stool DNA test. The typical preparations for other colorectal cancer screening tests are below. For a colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy, you will need to do a bowel prep. Your provider will give you specific instructions on how to do your bowel prep, but steps for bowel prep may include: Following a liquid diet for one to three days before the test. Drinking plenty of clear liquids one to three days before the test. Clear liquids include water, black coffee or tea, fat-free broth, and sports drinks without added color. Drinking a strong liquid laxative and/or using an enema on the evening before your test. The laxative or enema will help you empty your bowels. You should prepare to spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Bowel prep can be inconvenient and uncomfortable, but if the colon is not thoroughly cleaned out, your provider may not be able to get a full picture of your colon and rectum. Polyps and other abnormal areas may not be seen. For a sigmoidoscopy, before the test, you may need to: Follow a clear liquid diet one or more days before the procedure. This isn't always required, so be sure to talk to your provider before the test. You may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) on the morning of the procedure. Use an enema to empty your bowels about one hour before the procedure. A second enema is sometimes needed. For a g(FOBT) test, you may need to avoid the following foods and medicines for several days before your test: Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin More than 250 mg of vitamin C daily from supplements, fruit juices, or fruit Red meat, such as beef, lamb, or pork Your health care provider will give you full instructions on how to prepare for your screening test.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no risks to having a fecal occult blood test or a stool DNA test. Serious risks of colonoscopy are rare but can include: Tears in the colon or rectum wall Bleeding Reaction to the sedative There are fewer risks to sigmoidoscopy than with a colonoscopy. Tears in the colon and bleeding can happen, but they are even less common than with a colonoscopy. In a virtual colonoscopy, risks include: Exposure to a small dose of radiation from the scan. Rarely, a tear in the colon or rectum can happen when it is inflated with air.1What do the results mean? If your fecal occult blood test or stool DNA test had abnormal results, it doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer. But your provider will probably order more tests, such as a colonoscopy, to help make a diagnosis. Abnormal results for the other types of screening tests may include the following: Colonoscopy Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were found and removed. Samples were sent to a lab for testing. Most polyps aren't cancerous but can turn into cancer if not removed. Depending on the size and number of polyps, your provider may recommend more frequent colonoscopies. Sigmoidoscopy Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were found. They may or may not be removed depending on their location. Whether or not your polyps were removed, you will probably need a colonoscopy so your provider can view your entire colon and rectum. Virtual colonoscopy Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were seen on the CT scan. You will probably need a traditional colonoscopy so your provider can get a tissue sample. Sometimes this procedure can be done on the same day as your virtual colonoscopy. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a colorectal cancer screening? Each type of screening test has advantages and disadvantages. You and your provider should discuss the benefits and risks of each option. The following may help guide your decision. Looks at the entire colon Can remove polyps and test for cancer May help find other diseases Needed only every 10 years (if no polyps were found in previous tests) Small risk of tears and bleeding Bowel prep needed Sedatives are needed for the procedure Takes at least one day for bowel prep and recovery Usually doesn't require bowel prep Sedatives are not usually needed Needed every five years (if no polyps were found in previous tests) Only looks at a third of the colon May miss small polyps Can't remove all polyps Very small risk of tears or bleeding Not widely used as a screening test Colonoscopy will be needed if results are abnormal Looks at the entire colon Sedatives not needed Needed every five years (if no polyps were found in previous tests) Bowel prep needed May miss small polyps Exposure to a small amount of radiation Traditional colonoscopy will be needed if results are abnormal Fairly new test; may not be covered by insurance No risk to colon No bowel prep Sample can be collected at home Can have false positives Cannot detect precancerous changes (cells that are at risk for turning into cancer) May miss some signs of polyps and/or cancer Colonoscopy will be needed if results are abnormal Should be done every year No risk to colon No bowel prep Sample can be collected at home Can have false positives Cannot detect precancerous changes May miss some signs of polyps and/or cancer Dietary restrictions required before testing Colonoscopy will be needed if results are abnormal Should be done every year No risk to colon No bowel prep Sample can be collected at home Can have false positives Cannot detect precancerous changes May miss some cancers Colonoscopy will be needed if results are abnormal Should be done every three years Fairly new test; may not be covered by insurance1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Available from: https://www.uwhealth.org/coloncancerscreening/colorectal-screening-initiative-frequently-asked-questions/25338 Colposcopy : 1What is a colposcopy? A colposcopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to closely examine a woman's cervix, vagina, and vulva. It uses a lighted, magnifying device called a colposcope. The device is placed at the opening of the vagina. It magnifies the normal view, allowing your provider to see problems that can't be seen by the eyes alone. If your provider sees a problem, he or she may take a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). The sample is most often taken from the cervix. This procedure is known as a cervical biopsy. Biopsies may also be taken from the vagina or vulva. A cervical, vaginal, or vulvar biopsy can show if you have cells that are at risk for becoming cancer. These are called precancerous cells. Finding and treating precancerous cells may prevent cancer from forming. Other names: colposcopy with directed biopsy1What is it used for? A colposcopy is most often used to find abnormal cells in the cervix, vagina, or vulva. It may also be used to: Check for genital warts, which may be a sign of an HPV (human papillomavirus) infection. Having HPV may put you at higher risk for developing cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer. Look for noncancerous growths called polyps Check for irritation or inflammation of the cervix If you've already been diagnosed and treated for HPV, the test may be used to monitor cell changes in the cervix. Sometimes abnormal cells return after treatment.1Why do I need a colposcopy? You may need this test if you had abnormal results on your Pap smear. A Pap smear is a test that involves getting a sample of cells from the cervix. It can show if there are abnormal cells, but it can't provide a diagnosis. A colposcopy provides a more detailed look at the cells, which may help your provider confirm a diagnosis and/or find other potential problems. You may also need this test if: You have been diagnosed with HPV Your provider sees abnormal areas on your cervix during a routine pelvic exam You have bleeding after sex1What happens during a colposcopy? A colposcopy may be done by your primary care provider or by a gynecologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases of the female reproductive system. The test is usually done in the provider's office. If abnormal tissue is found, you may also get a biopsy. During a colposcopy: You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown. You will lie on your back on an exam table with your feet in stirrups. Your provider will insert a tool called a speculum into your vagina. It is used to spread open your vaginal walls. Your provider will gently swab your cervix and vagina with a vinegar or iodine solution. This makes abnormal tissues easier to see. Your provider will place the colposcope near your vagina. But the device will not touch your body. Your provider will look through the colposcope, which provides a magnified view of the cervix, vagina, and vulva. If any areas of tissue look abnormal, your provider may perform a cervical, vaginal, or vulvar biopsy. During a biopsy: A vaginal biopsy can be painful, so your provider may first give you a medicine to numb the area. Once the area is numb, your provider will use a small tool to remove a sample of tissue for testing. Sometimes many samples are taken. Your provider may also do a procedure called an endocervical curettage (ECC) to take a sample from the inside of the opening of the cervix. This area can't be seen during a colposcopy. An ECC is done with a special tool called a curette. You may feel a slight pinch or cramp as the tissue is removed. Your provider may apply a topical medicine to the biopsy site to treat any bleeding you may have. After a biopsy, you should not douche, use tampons, or have sex for a week after your procedure, or for as long as your health care provider advises.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Do not douche, use tampons or vaginal medicines, or have sex for at least 24 hours before the test. Also, it's best to schedule your colposcopy when you are not having your menstrual period. And be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Colposcopy is generally safe during pregnancy, but if a biopsy is needed, it can cause extra bleeding.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a colposcopy. You may have some discomfort when the speculum is inserted into the vagina, and the vinegar or iodine solution may sting. A biopsy is also a safe procedure. You may feel a pinch when the tissue sample is taken. After the procedure, your vagina may be sore for a day or two. You may have some cramping and slight bleeding. It's normal to have a little bleeding and discharge for up to a week after the biopsy. Serious complications from a biopsy are rare, but call your provider if you have any of the following symptoms: Heavy bleeding Abdominal pain Signs of infection, such as fever, chills and/or bad smelling vaginal discharge1What do the results mean? During your colposcopy, your provider may find one or more of the following conditions: Genital warts Polyps Swelling or irritation of the cervix Abnormal tissue If your provider also performed a biopsy, your results may show you have: Precancerous cells in the cervix, vagina, or vulva An HPV infection Cancer of the cervix, vagina, or vulva If your biopsy results were normal, it's unlikely that you have cells in your cervix, vagina, or vulva that are at risk for turning into cancer. But that can change. So your provider may want to monitor you for cell changes with more frequent Pap smears and/or additional colposcopies. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a colposcopy? If your results showed you have precancerous cells, your provider may schedule another procedure to remove them. This may prevent cancer from developing. If cancer was found, you may be referred to a gynecologic oncologist, a provider who specializes in treating cancers of the female reproductive system.1References ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw4205 Complement Blood Test : 1What is a complement blood test? A complement blood test measures the amount or activity of complement proteins in the blood. Complement proteins are part of the complement system. This system is made up of a group of proteins that work with the immune system to identify and fight disease-causing substances like viruses and bacteria. There are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. Complement proteins may be measured individually or together. C3 and C4 proteins are the most commonly tested individual complement proteins. A CH50 test (sometimes called CH100) measures the amount and activity of all the major complement proteins. If the test shows that your complement protein levels are not normal or that the proteins aren't working with the immune system as well as they should, it can be a sign of an autoimmune disease or other serious health problem. Other names: complement antigen, compliment activity C3, C4, CH50, CH100, C1 C1q, C21What is it used for? A complement blood test is most often used to diagnose or monitor autoimmune disorders such as: Lupus, a chronic disease affecting multiple parts of the body, including the joints, blood vessels, kidneys, and brain Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that causes pain and swelling of the joints, mostly in the hands and feet It may also be used to help diagnose certain bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.1Why do I need a complement blood test? You may need a complement blood test if you have symptoms of an autoimmune disorder, especially lupus. Symptoms of lupus include: A butterfly-shaped rash across your nose and cheeks Fatigue Mouth sores Hair loss Sensitivity to sunlight Swollen lymph nodes Chest pain when breathing deeply Joint pain Fever You may also need this test if you are being treated for lupus or other autoimmune disorder. The test can show how well the treatment is working.1What happens during a complement blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a complement blood test.1Are there any risks to a complement blood test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show lower than normal amounts or decreased activity of complement proteins, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Lupus Rheumatoid arthritis Cirrhosis Certain types of kidney disease Hereditary angioedema, a rare but serious disorder of the immune system. It can cause swelling of the face and airways. Malnutrition A recurrent infection (usually bacterial) If your results show higher than normal amounts or increased activity of complement proteins, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Certain types of cancer, such as leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma Ulcerative colitis, a condition in which the lining of the large intestine and rectum become inflamed If you are being treated for lupus or another autoimmune disease, increased amounts or activity of complement proteins may mean your treatment is working. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

A complete blood count, or CBC, is a blood test that measures many different parts and features of your blood, including: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. White blood cells, which fight infections and other diseases. There are five major types of white blood cells. A CBC test measures the total number of white cells in your blood. A different test called a CBC with differential measures the number of each type of these white blood cells. Platelets, which stop bleeding by helping your blood to clot. Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Hematocrit, a measurement of how much of your blood is made up of red blood cells. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. Other names for a complete blood count: CBC, full blood count, blood cell count1What is it used for? A complete blood count is a common blood test that is often part of a routine checkup. Complete blood counts can help detect a variety of disorders including infections, anemia, diseases of the immune system, and blood cancers.1Why do I need a complete blood count? Your health care provider may have ordered a complete blood count as part of your checkup or to monitor your overall health. The test may also be used to: Help diagnose  blood diseases, infection, immune system disorders, or other medical conditions Check for changes in an existing blood disorder1What happens during a complete blood count? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Usually there is no special preparation necessary for a complete blood count. But if your provider ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle went in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A CBC counts the cells in your blood. There are many reasons your levels may not be in the normal range. For example: Abnormal levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, or hematocrit may be a sign of anemia, heart disease, or too little iron in your body. Low white cell count may be a sign of an autoimmune disorder, bone marrow disorder, or cancer. High white cell count may be a sign of an infection or a reaction to medicine. If any of your levels are abnormal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Diet, activity level, medicines, a menstrual period, not drinking enough water, and other factors can affect the results. Talk with your provider to learn what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a complete blood count? A complete blood count is only one tool your health care provider uses to learn about your health. Your provider will consider your medical history, symptoms, and other factors to make a diagnosis. You may also need additional tests.1References Mayo Clinic [Internet]. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research; c1998-2022.

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a test that measures 14 different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how the body uses food and energy. A CMP includes tests for the following: Glucose, a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy. Calcium, one of the body's most important minerals. Calcium is essential for proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart. Sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, and chloride. These are electrolytes, electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body. Albumin, a protein made in the liver. Total protein, which measures the total amount of protein in the blood. ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). These are different enzymes made by the liver. Bilirubin, a waste product made by the liver. BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine, waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys. Abnormal levels of any of these substances or combination of them can be a sign of a serious health problem. Other names: chem 14, chemistry panel, chemistry screen, metabolic panel1What is it used for? A CMP is used to check several body functions and processes, including: Liver and kidney health Blood sugar levels Blood protein levels Acid and base balance Fluid and electrolyte balance Metabolism A CMP may also be used to monitor the side effects of certain medicines.1Why do I need a CMP? A CMP is often done as part of a regular checkup. You may also need this test if your health care provider thinks you have liver or kidney disease.1What happens during a CMP? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least 8 hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If any one result or combination of CMP results were not normal, it can indicate a number of different conditions. These include liver disease, kidney failure, or diabetes. You will likely need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CMP? There is a similar test to a CMP called a basic metabolic panel (BMP). A BMP includes eight of the same tests as a CMP. It does not include the liver and protein tests. Your provider may choose a CMP or a BMP depending on your health history and needs.1References Brenner Children's: Wake Forest Baptist Health [Internet]. Winston-Salem (NC): Brenner; c2016.

Concussion tests can help find out if an adult or child has had a concussion after a head injury. A concussion is also called a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). A concussion happens when sudden movement causes the brain to bounce around or twist inside the skull. It can be caused by a bump or blow to the head.  It may also happen if a hit to the body causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This jolting movement can create chemical changes in the brain. And it can stretch and damage brain cells. Even though a concussion is a "mild" brain injury, it can seriously affect the brain. Most people don't lose consciousness when they have a concussion. But some signs and symptoms usually show up right away after the injury and others may appear hours or days later. Symptoms are different for each person, but often include headaches, problems with memory, and changes in how a person thinks, acts, feels, and sleeps. The symptoms of a concussion are usually temporary. With treatment most people feel better in a couple weeks. The main treatment is physical and mental rest. Without proper rest, recovery from a concussion may take longer. There are many types of concussion tests that health care providers use to help diagnose concussions. They usually include questionnaires that you fill out and tests of mental and physical abilities. Some tests have special versions for children. All concussion tests have scoring systems that help show how much an injury has affected the brain. The tests check: How well your brain processes information. This includes testing memory, problem solving, and other brain functions. These tests are often done on a computer or on paper. How well your nervous system is working. These tests check balance, muscle coordination, and other physical abilities. A provider often does these tests as part of a physical exam. A concussion will not show up on imaging tests that take pictures of the brain. So, these tests usually aren't needed to diagnose a concussion. But a CT or MRI scan of the brain may be done if there are signs of a more serious brain injury, such as bleeding in the brain. Some concussion tests are designed for sports coaches or trainers to use with athletes of all ages who have hurt their heads playing sports. These tests are sometimes called "sideline assessments." They are not a substitute for a medical examination after a blow to the head. Other names: concussion assessment1What are they used for? Concussion tests are used after a head injury to see if the injury is affecting brain function.  The tests are also be used to monitor recovery after a concussion. Athletes, including student athletes, may have a routine concussion test at the start of the sports season even when they haven't had a brain injury. This is called a "baseline test," and it's usually done by a trained health care professional. The purpose of baseline testing is to have a record of the athlete's normal brain function. Later on, if the athlete has a head injury, a provider can compare the baseline test results with the results of a concussion test done after the injury. This helps to: Confirm or rule out a concussion Find out how severe a concussion is Know when an athlete is fully recovered and ready to return to normal activities Baseline concussion tests are mostly done on athletes who play contacts sports that have a high risk for concussion, such as football and hockey.1Why do I need concussion testing? You may need concussion testing if you have had a head injury or a blow to the body that jolts your head. Testing may be necessary even if you think the injury isn't serious. That's because it's possible to have a concussion and not even know it. Concussion symptoms usually show up soon after a head injury. But sometimes, they don't show up for hours or days. So, it's important to keep watching for signs and symptoms of a concussion for a day or two after a head injury. Signs and symptoms of a concussion include: Appearing dazed or stunned Clumsy movements Answering questions slowly Headache Nausea or vomiting Fatigue Confusion Dizziness Sensitivity to light and/or blurry or double vision Changes in sleep and/or mood Difficulty paying attention Memory problems In rare cases, a dangerous blood clot can form on the brain a day or two after a head injury. This is a medical emergency. Call 911 or go to an emergency department right away if a child or adult has one or more of these symptoms: A headache that gets worse or doesn't go away Weakness, numbness, decreased coordination, or seizures Repeated vomiting Slurred speech and/or unusual behavior One pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye) that's larger than the other Confusion Not being able to wake up, a loss of consciousness, or looking very drowsy For infants and toddlers, the symptoms of a medical emergency are the same as for adults and children, but also include: Crying that won't stop Not eating or nursing1What happens during concussion testing? To do concussion testing a provider will usually use one or more standard concussion tests to learn about the injury and how it's affecting the brain. During the testing you'll usually: Answer questions about the injury, such as:

How the head injury happened
Whether the injured person was unconscious and for how long
Signs and symptoms after the injury

 How the head injury happened Whether the injured person was unconscious and for how long Signs and symptoms after the injury Take a test, often on a computer, to check for problems with:

Learning
Memory
Thinking and reasoning
Ability to pay attention

 Learning Memory Thinking and reasoning Ability to pay attention Have a physical exam that checks for problems with:

Vision and eye movement
Hearing
Balance
Coordination
Reflexes

 Vision and eye movement Hearing Balance Coordination Reflexes In certain cases, your provider may order a blood test to help decide if a brain scan is needed to check for a more serious injury. The test checks a blood sample for certain proteins that may show up in the bloodstream after a mild concussion.  To collect a blood sample, a health care professional inserts a small needle into a vein in your arm and collects a small amount of blood into a test tube or vial.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a concussion test? You don't need any special preparations for concussion testing.1Are there any risks to the tests? There's little risk to having concussion testing. If you have a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but it usually goes away quickly.1What do the results mean? If concussion testing shows that a head injury has caused a concussion, the treatment is physical and mental rest to help the brain heal. This often includes limiting time spent on electronic screens (televisions, computers, phones, and tablets). It may also be necessary to take two or three days off from school or work. Ask your provider about a recovery plan, including how to relieve symptoms. As symptoms improve, physical and mental activities can gradually be increased. But it's important to make sure that the concussion is fully healed before returning to all usual activities. That's because having a second concussion before the first has healed can cause serious brain damage. Your provider may do another concussion test to see if recovery is complete. Complete healing is very important for athletes who want to return to their sport after a concussion. Different sports organizations may have "concussion protocols" that set guidelines for when an athlete can participate again after having a concussion. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about concussion testing? Concussions are common among children and young adults. Adults age 75 and up also have a higher-than-average risk of concussion because they have a higher risk for falls. But there are steps you can take to prevent concussions at any age, including: Wearing the correct helmet and making sure it fits when you or your child play sports such as, biking, skiing, skating, hockey, football, and batting in baseball or softball Wearing seat belts Preventing falls by keeping your home well-lit, removing tripping hazards, and using nonslip mats and grab bars in the bathroom Making home and play areas safe for young children:

Making sure playgrounds have shock-absorbing material, such as mulch or sand
Installing window guards
Using safety gates on stairs

Cord blood is the blood left in the umbilical cord after a baby is born. The umbilical cord is the rope-like structure that connects a mother to her unborn baby during pregnancy. It contains blood vessels that bring nourishment to the baby and remove waste products. After a baby is born, the cord is cut with a small piece remaining. This piece will heal and form the baby's belly button. Cord blood testing Once the umbilical cord has been cut, a health care provider may take a sample of blood from the cord for testing. These tests may measure a variety of substances and check for infections or other disorders. Cord blood banking Some people want to bank (save and store) blood from their baby's umbilical cord for future use in treating diseases. The umbilical cord is full of special cells called stem cells. Unlike other cells, stem cells have the ability to grow into many different types of cells. These include bone marrow, blood cells, and brain cells. Stem cells in cord blood can be used to treat certain blood disorders, including leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and some types of anemia. Researchers are studying whether stem cells can also treat other types of diseases.1What is cord blood testing used for? Cord blood testing may be used to: Measure blood gases. This helps to see if a baby's blood has a healthy level of oxygen and other substances. Measure bilirubin levels. Bilirubin is a waste product made by the liver. High bilirubin levels can be a sign of a liver disease. Perform a blood culture. This test may be done if a provider thinks a baby has an infection. Measure different parts of the blood with a complete blood count. This is done more often on premature babies. Check for signs of a baby's exposure to illegal or misused prescription drugs a mother may have taken during pregnancy. Umbilical cord blood can show signs of a variety of drugs, including opiates; such as heroin and fentanyl; cocaine; marijuana; and sedatives. If any of these drugs are found in cord blood, a health care provider can take steps to treat the baby and help avoid complications such as developmental delays.1What is cord blood banking used for? You may want to consider banking your baby's cord blood if you: Have a family history of a blood disorder or certain cancers. Your baby's stem cells will be a close genetic match to his or her sibling or other family member. The blood may be helpful in treatment. Want to protect your child from a future illness, although it's unlikely that a child can be treated with his or her own stem cells. That's because a child's own stem cells may have the same problem that led to the disease in the first place. Want to help others. You can donate your baby's cord blood to a facility that provides lifesaving stem cells to patients in need.1How is cord blood collected? Soon after your baby is born, the umbilical cord will be cut to separate the baby from your body. The cord used to be routinely cut right after birth, but leading health organizations now recommend waiting at least one minute before cutting. This helps improve blood flow to the baby, which may have long-term health benefits. After the cord is cut, a health care provider will use a tool called a clamp to stop the cord from bleeding. The provider will then use a needle to withdraw blood from the cord. The cord blood will be packaged and either sent to a lab for testing or to a cord blood bank for long-term storage.1How is cord blood banked? There are two types of umbilical cord blood banks. Private banks. These facilities save your baby's cord blood for your family's personal use. These facilities charge a fee for collection and storage. However, there is no guarantee the cord blood will be useful to treat your baby or a member of your family in the future. Public banks. These facilities use cord blood to help others and to do research. Cord blood in public banks may be used by anyone who needs it.1Is there any preparation needed for cord blood testing or banking? There are no special preparations needed for cord blood testing. If you want to bank your baby's cord blood, talk to your health care provider early in your pregnancy. This will give you time to get more information and review your options.1Are there any risks to cord blood testing or banking? There is no risk to cord blood testing. Cord blood banking at a private facility can be very expensive. The cost is usually not covered by insurance.1What do cord blood test results mean? Cord blood test results will depend on what substances were measured. If results were not normal, talk to your health care provider to see if your baby needs treatment. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about cord blood testing or banking? Unless you have a family history of certain blood disorders or cancers, it's unlikely your baby's cord blood will help your baby or your family. But research is ongoing and the future of using stem cells for treatment looks promising. Also, if you save your baby's cord blood at a public cord bank, you may be able to help patients right now. For more information on cord blood and/or stem cells, talk to your health care provider.1References ACOG: The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [Internet].

A cortisol test measures the level of cortisol in your blood, urine, or saliva to see if your levels are normal. Cortisol is a hormone that affects almost every organ and tissue in your body. It helps your body: Respond to stress (cortisol is sometimes called the "stress hormone") Reduce inflammation Regulate blood sugar and metabolism (how your body uses food for energy) Control blood pressure Cortisol is made by your adrenal glands, two small glands that sit above the kidneys. A gland in your brain, called the pituitary gland, makes a hormone that tells your adrenal glands how much cortisol to make. If your cortisol levels are too high or too low, it may mean you have a disorder of your adrenal glands, a problem with your pituitary gland, or a tumor that makes cortisol. High levels of cortisol may also happen if you take large doses of certain steroid medicines, such as prednisone, for a long time. And low levels may happen if you stop the medicine suddenly. Without treatment, cortisol levels that are too high or too low can be very serious. Other names: urinary cortisol, salivary cortisol, free cortisol, blood cortisol, plasma cortisol1What is it used for? A cortisol test is used to help diagnose medical conditions that cause too much or too little cortisol. These conditions include disorders that affect the adrenal glands: Cushing's syndrome is a disorder that happens when your body has too much cortisol over a long period of time. Addison disease is a condition in which your adrenal glands are damaged and can't make enough cortisol. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which your adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol because your pituitary gland isn't working properly. Cortisol testing is also used to monitor treatment for these conditions.1Why do I need a cortisol test? You may need a cortisol test if you have symptoms of a condition that affects cortisol levels. Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome (too much cortisol) may include:

Weight gain
Thin arms and legs
Round face
Increased fat around the base of the neck or between the shoulder blades
Easy bruising
Wide purple streaks on the stomach, breasts, hips, and under the arms
Muscle weakness

 Weight gain Thin arms and legs Round face Increased fat around the base of the neck or between the shoulder blades Easy bruising Wide purple streaks on the stomach, breasts, hips, and under the arms Muscle weakness Common symptoms of Addison disease and adrenal insufficiency (not enough cortisol) may include:

Long-lasting fatigue
Muscle weakness
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Abdominal (belly) pain

 Long-lasting fatigue Muscle weakness Loss of appetite Weight loss Abdominal (belly) pain1What happens during a cortisol test? A cortisol test often uses a sample of blood drawn at a lab. But the test may also be done on urine or saliva collected at home. Normally, cortisol levels vary during the day, so your provider may order more than one type of test to get more information about your cortisol levels. For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Blood samples are usually taken twice during the day--once in the morning when cortisol levels are at their highest, and again around 4 p.m., when levels are much lower. For a cortisol urine test, your provider may ask you to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a "24-hour urine sample test."  For this test, you'll be given a special container and instructions for how to collect and store your urine sample. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test usually includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. Store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice during the collection period. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed. In certain cases, a urine test for cortisol may be done on one sample of urine collected in the morning. A cortisol saliva test is usually done at home with a kit to collect a saliva sample. Your provider will tell you what time to collect your sample. It's often done at night before you go to bed when cortisol levels are normally lower. Most kits include a swab and a container to store it. Be careful to follow the instructions that come with your kit. They usually include these general steps: Do not eat, drink, brush, or floss your teeth for 30 minutes before the test. Wash and dry your hands. Open the tube that holds the swab and let the swab fall into your mouth without touching it with your hands. Roll the swab in your mouth or hold it under your tongue for about 2 minutes until it is soaked with saliva. Spit the swab back into the tube without touching it and close the tube. Label the tube with the time you collected the sample. Take your saliva sample to your doctor's office or the lab the next day as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? The preparations will depend on the type of test you are having. Be sure to follow all the instructions that your provider gives you. Stress can raise your cortisol levels, so you may need to rest before your test. A blood test will require you to schedule two appointments at different times of the day. Before a saliva test, you may need to stop using certain medicines. Let your provider know about all medicines you use, including skin creams. But don't stop using any medicines without talking with your provider first.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to a urine or saliva test.1What do the results mean? A cortisol test alone can't diagnose the cause of abnormal cortisol levels. If your cortisol level isn't normal, you will usually have more tests to find out what is causing the problem. High levels of cortisol may be a sign that you have Cushing's syndrome. It may be caused by: Taking high doses of certain steroid medicines for a long time to treat conditions, such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus Tumors in your pituitary gland or other parts of your body that make too much of the hormone that tells your adrenal glands to make cortisol Tumors in your adrenal glands that make extra cortisol Low levels of cortisol may mean you have Addison disease or secondary adrenal insufficiency: Common causes of Addison's disease include damage to the adrenal glands from conditions, such as:

Autoimmune diseases
Certain infections, such as tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS

 Autoimmune diseases Certain infections, such as tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS Common causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency include:

Autoimmune diseases
Problems with the pituitary gland
Traumatic brain injury

 Autoimmune diseases Problems with the pituitary gland Traumatic brain injury The most common cause of low cortisol levels is suddenly stopping steroid medicines after using them for a long time. If your cortisol results aren't normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Cortisol levels can be affected by: Stress Pregnancy  Exercise Serious illness Hot and cold temperatures Certain thyroid diseases Obesity Certain medicines, such as birth control pills To learn what your test results mean, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a cortisol test? A cortisol test is one of the tests that may be used to help diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol.1References Allina Health [Internet]. Allina Health; c2019.

This test measures the amount of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood. CK is a type of protein, known as an enzyme. It is mostly found in your skeletal muscles and heart, with lesser amounts in the brain. Skeletal muscles are the muscles attached to your skeleton. They work with your bones to help you move and give your body power and strength. Heart muscles pump blood in and out of the heart. There are three types of CK enzymes: CK-MM, found mostly in skeletal muscles CK-MB, found mostly in the heart muscle CK-BB, found mostly in brain tissue A small amount of CK in the blood is normal. Higher amounts can mean a health problem. Depending on the type and level of CK found, it can mean you have damage or disease of the skeletal muscles, heart, or brain. Other names: CK, total CK, creatine phosphokinase, CPK1What is it used for? A CK test is most often used to diagnose and monitor muscular injuries and diseases. These diseases include: Muscular dystrophy, a rare inherited disease that causes weakness, breakdown, and loss of function of skeletal muscles. It mostly occurs in males. Rhabdomyolis, a rapid breakdown of muscle tissue. It can be caused by a serious injury, muscle disease, or other disorder. The test can be used to help diagnose a heart attack, though not very often. CK testing used to be a common test for heart attacks. But another test, called troponin, has been found to be better at detecting heart damage.1Why do I need a CK test? You may need a CK test if you have symptoms of a muscular disorder. These include: Muscle pain and/or cramps Muscle weakness Balance problems Numbness or tingling You may also need this test if you had a muscle injury or stroke. CK levels may not peak until up to two days after certain injuries, so you may need to be tested a few times. This test can help show if you have damage to your heart or other muscles.1What happens during a CK test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a CK test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show you have a higher than normal level of CK, it may mean you have an injury or disease of the muscles, heart, or brain. To get more information, your provider may order tests to check the levels of specific CK enzymes: If you have higher than normal CK-MM enzymes, it may mean you have a muscle injury or disease, such as muscular dystrophy or rhabdomyolis. If you have higher than normal CK-MB enzymes, it may mean you have an inflammation of the heart muscle or are having or recently had a heart attack. If you have higher than normal CK-BB enzymes, it may mean you have had a stroke or brain injury. Other conditions that can cause higher than normal CK levels include: Blood clots Infections Hormonal disorders, including disorders of the thyroid and adrenal glands Lengthy surgery Certain medicines Strenuous exercise If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CK test? Other blood tests, such as an electrolyte panel and kidney function tests, may be ordered along with a CK test.1References Cedars-Sinai [Internet]. Los Angeles: Cedars-Sinai; c2019.

This test measures creatinine levels in blood and/or urine. Creatinine is a waste product made by your muscles as part of regular, everyday activity. Normally, your kidneys filter creatinine from your blood and send it out of the body in your urine. If there is a problem with your kidneys, creatinine can build up in the blood and less will be released in urine. If blood and/or urine creatinine levels are not normal, it can be a sign of kidney disease. Other names: blood creatinine, serum creatinine, urine creatinine1What is it used for? A creatinine test is used to see if your kidneys are working normally. It's often ordered along with another kidney test called blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). A CMP is a group of tests that provide information about different organs and systems in the body. A CMP is frequently included in a routine checkup.1Why do I need a creatinine test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of kidney disease. These include: Fatigue Puffiness around the eyes Swelling in your feet and/or ankles Decreased appetite Frequent and painful urination Urine that is foamy or bloody You may also need this test if you have certain risk factors for kidney disease. You may be at higher risk for kidney disease if you have: Type 1 or type 2 diabetes High blood pressure A family history of kidney disease1What happens during a creatinine test? Creatinine can be tested in blood or urine. For a creatinine blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a creatinine urine test: Your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. Your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test generally includes the following steps: Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time. For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided. Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice. Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may be told to not eat cooked meat for 24 hours before your test. Studies have shown that cooked meat can temporarily raise creatinine levels.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a urine test.1What do the results mean? In general, high levels of creatinine in blood and low levels in urine indicate kidney disease or another condition that affects kidney function. These include: Autoimmune diseases Bacterial infection of the kidneys Blocked urinary tract Heart failure Complications of diabetes But abnormal results don't always mean kidney disease. The following conditions can temporarily raise creatinine levels: Pregnancy Intense exercise A diet high in red meat Certain medicines. Some medicines have side effects that raise creatinine levels. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a creatinine test? Your health care provider may also order a creatinine clearance test. A creatinine clearance test compares the level of creatinine in blood with the level of creatinine in urine. A creatinine clearance test may provide more accurate information on kidney function than a blood or urine test alone.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

A crystals in urine test checks a sample of your urine (pee) for crystals. It shows what the crystals are made of, how large they are, and how many are in your urine. Your urine contains many dissolved substances, including minerals. If you have too many minerals in your urine, certain minerals may clump together with other substances and form solid crystals. It's normal to have a few small crystals in your urine. But certain types of crystals may stick together and become kidney stones, which are hard, pebble-like pieces of material that form in the kidneys. Kidney stones can be as small as a grain of sand or as big as a pea or even larger. The acidity of your urine and can affect how stones form. Small kidney stones may pass out of your body through your urine with little or no pain. A large kidney stone may get stuck and block your urine flow. This can cause pain or bleeding. But with treatment, kidney stones rarely cause serious damage. Other names: urinalysis (crystals) microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine1What is it used for? A crystals in urine test is often part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different substances in your urine. A urinalysis is used to check your general health, including the health of your urinary tract and kidneys. It may include a visual check of your urine sample, tests for certain chemicals, and an examination under a microscope to look for certain types of cells. A crystals in urine test is part of a microscopic exam of urine. It may be used to help diagnose kidney stones. A crystals in urine test may also help diagnose a problem with your metabolism, the process of how your body uses food and energy. Problems with metabolism can affect both the amount of minerals in your urine and the amount of substances that prevent minerals from forming crystals.1Why do I need a crystals in urine test? A urinalysis is often part of a routine checkup. Your health care provider may include a crystals in urine test in your urinalysis if you have symptoms of a kidney stone. These include: Sharp pains in your lower abdomen (belly), side, groin, or back Blood in your urine Frequent need to urinate Not being able to urinate at all or only urinating a little bit Pain when urinating Cloudy or bad-smelling urine Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills1What happens during a crystals in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. This test may use the clean catch method or could be a 24-hour urine test. Clean Catch A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. 24-hour Urine Test Your provider may also request that you collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a "24-hour urine sample test." It may provide more complete results because the amount  of crystals and other substances in urine can vary throughout the day. If you need to have a 24-hour urine sample test, you'll be given a special container and instructions for how to collect and store your urine sample. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test usually includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. Store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is your last urine collection. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a crystals in urine test. To make sure your test results are accurate, be sure to carefully follow all the instructions for providing your urine sample.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a crystals in urine test.1What do the results mean? If your test results show that you have many crystals, large crystals, or certain types of crystals in your urine, it may be a sign that you have: One or more kidney stones Have a high risk of developing kidney stones A problem with your metabolism that affects the amount of minerals in your urine and/or the amount of substances that prevent crystals from forming A urinary tract infection (UTI) A genetic condition that causes kidney stones, such as cystinuria (uncommon) Your provider may need to order other tests to make a diagnosis. Having crystals in your urine doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. If you have a small kidney stone, it may pass through your urine on its own with little or no pain. Also, certain medicines, your diet, not drinking enough fluids, and other things can lead to crystals in urine. If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a crystals in urine test? Different minerals and other substances form different types of crystals in urine. A crystals in urine test can tell what type of crystals are in your urine. This information helps your provider understand why the crystals are forming and what would help reduce your risk for developing kidney stones in the future, such as: Drinking more water Making changes in your diet Taking or avoiding certain medicines1References Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Crystals in Urine [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw6580 CSF Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Index : 1What is a CSF IgG index? CSF stands for cerebrospinal fluid. It is a clear, colorless fluid that flows in and around your brain and spinal cord. Your brain and spinal cord make up your central nervous system. Cerebrospinal fluid cushions your central nervous system from impact or injury. It also removes waste products from the brain and helps your central nervous system work properly. IgG stands for immunoglobulin G. It is a type of antibody. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight germs. A CSF IgG index measures the levels of IgG in your cerebrospinal fluid. Normally you have a tiny amount of IgG in your cerebrospinal fluid. High levels of IgG may mean you have an infection or an inflammatory or autoimmune disease that involves your central nervous system. An autoimmune disorder causes your immune system to attack your own healthy cells by mistake, which can lead to serious health problems. Other names: cerebrospinal fluid IgG level, cerebrospinal fluid IgG measurement, CSF IgG level, IgG (Immunoglobulin G) spinal fluid, IgG synthesis rate1What is it used for? A CSF IgG index is used to check for diseases of the central nervous system. It is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disorder that attacks the outside covering of your nerves. Most people with MS have higher than normal levels of IgG. But a CSF IgG test alone can't diagnose MS.1Why do I need a CSF IgG index? You may need a CSF IgG index if you have symptoms of a central nervous system disorder, especially multiple sclerosis (MS). The symptoms of MS often vary. They may come and go or steadily get worse. They include: Blurred or double vision Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, body, or face Painful muscle spasms Weak muscles, often in the hands and legs Dizziness  Problems with balance and walking Bladder control problems Fatigue Problems with thinking or memory1What happens during a CSF IgG index? To get a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. During the procedure: You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table. A provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection. When the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine. Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes. You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn. Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a CSF IgG index, but you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back at the site where the needle was inserted. You may also have some bleeding at the site or get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more, but your provider may suggest treatment to help relieve the pain.1What do the results mean? A CSF IgG index that's higher than normal may be a sign of an infection or an inflammatory or autoimmune condition that affects your central nervous system, such as: Multiple sclerosis Transverse myelitis (TM) Syphilis that infects your nervous system (neurosyphilis) Connective tissue disorders Guillain-Barre syndrome  Encephalitis caused by herpes simplex You may need more tests before your provider can diagnose your condition. A CSF IgG index that's lower than normal may be a sign that your body is unable to make enough IgG antibodies, and you are likely to get sick with infections. Experts don't know what causes this problem. Normally, a test of IgG levels in blood is used to check whether you may lack IgG antibodies. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a CSF IgG index? The CSF IgG index is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS), but there is no specific test for MS. If your provider thinks you have MS, you will probably have other tests to help diagnose or rule out the disease. While there is no cure for MS, there are many treatments available that can relieve symptoms and help keep it from getting worse.1References Allina Health [Internet].

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus in the herpes family. Other types of herpes viruses include chickenpox and mononucleosis (mono). CMV infections are very common. In the United States, over half of adults have been exposed to CMV at some point in their lives, often during childhood or early adulthood. After initial infection, the virus remains in the body for the rest of your life. Most of the time, the virus stays dormant (inactive). However, it can become active again (reactivated) in certain situations such as stress or an immune system problem. In healthy people, CMV infections usually cause mild, flu-like illnesses or no symptoms at all. Most people with CMV don't even know they have it. But CMV can be dangerous to people with weakened immune systems due to conditions such as HIV or cancer. It can also cause significant health problems in infants. A pregnant woman with an active CMV infection can pass the virus to her unborn baby. CMV can cause deafness, vision problems, intellectual disabilities, and other serious disorders in babies who are infected before birth. CMV tests check for signs of the virus in the blood, sputum, or other body fluids. CMV testing can help those at risk for complications get the treatment they need. While there is no cure for CMV, antiviral medicines and other treatments may reduce symptoms and improve outcomes. 
Other names: CMV IgG and IgM, cytomegalovirus antibody1What are they used for? CMV tests are used to help diagnose a current, reactivated, or past CMV infection in people at risk for health complications. Risk groups include: People with weakened immune systems due to certain infections or diseases People who have recently received an organ transplant Pregnant women with symptoms of a CMV infection Newborns with symptoms of infection1Why do I need a CMV test? You may need testing if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant and have the following symptoms: Swollen lymph nodes Sore throat Fever Fatigue Weakness Muscle aches Headache Your baby may need this test if he or she has the following symptoms: Jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and eyes to turn yellow Low birth weight Small head Hearing and/or vision problems Seizures1What happens during a CMV test? There are several types of CMV tests, including: Blood tests This is the most common way to test adults for CMV. During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. CSF test A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected through a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. During the test, a provider will inject a numbing medicine (anesthetic) into your back and insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small bones that make up your spine. Your provider will then withdraw a small amount of fluid for testing. Sputum test Sputum is a thick mucus that settles in your lungs when you have an infection or chronic illness. During the test, your health care provider will ask you to breathe deeply and then cough deeply into a special cup. Your provider may tap you on the chest to help loosen sputum from your lungs. Biopsy During the test, your provider will remove a small sample of tissue for testing. Biopsies can be done with a needle or a special type of surgical instrument. Amniocentesis This procedure is done on pregnant women to see if an unborn baby has been infected with CMV. During the procedure, you'll lie on your back on an exam table. Your provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen. Ultrasound uses sound waves to check the position of your uterus, placenta, and baby. Your provider will insert a thin needle into your abdomen and withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid. Newborns are usually given a saliva or urine test. During an infant saliva test: A provider will insert a sterile swab into your baby's cheek and swirl for several seconds. The swab will be placed in a special solution for testing. During an infant urine test: You will be given a special plastic bag that will fit over your baby's genital area. You will place a diaper over the bag. After your baby has urinated, you will remove the bag from the diaper and empty the urine into a container given to you by your provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a blood or sputum test. There are also no preparations needed for an infant saliva or urine test. You may need to empty your bladder before a lumbar puncture. You may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before a biopsy. For an amniocentesis, you may be asked to keep a full bladder or empty your bladder right before the procedure, depending on your stage of pregnancy. Your provider or your child's provider will let you know if you need to make any other preparations.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a sputum test, infant saliva test, or infant urine test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. If you had a lumbar puncture, you may have pain or tenderness in your back when the needle is inserted. You may also get a headache after the procedure. The headache can last for several hours or up to a week or more. If you had a biopsy, you may have a little bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the biopsy site. This usually goes away after a few days. If you had an amniocentesis, you may have some mild discomfort and/or cramping during and/or after the procedure, but serious complications are rare. The procedure does have a slight risk (less than 1 percent) of causing a miscarriage.1What do the results mean? The test result can show whether you have been infected with CMV. But it can't show if it's a current, past, or reactivated infection. If you have symptoms and/or risk factors such as an immune system disorder, your provider may do additional tests to help make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan. If you are pregnant and your amniocentesis shows your baby has CMV, your child's provider may test and treat your baby soon after birth to help prevent complications. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider or your child's provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about CMV testing? CMV tests are included as part of a TORCH panel, a group of blood tests used to screen newborns and sometimes pregnant woman for the following infections: TOxoplasmosis Rubella Cytomegalovirus Herpes simplex virus These infections can cause birth defects if a mother gets infected during pregnancy. Early diagnosis and treatment may help prevent a baby from getting a serious health problem.1References Baby's First Test [Internet]. Expecting Health; c2020.

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-cmv-cytomegalovirus-1191881 D-Dimer Test : 1What is a D-dimer test? A D-dimer test looks for D-dimer in blood. D-dimer is a protein fragment (small piece) that's made when a blood clot dissolves in your body. Blood clotting is an important process that prevents you from losing too much blood when you are injured. Normally, your body will dissolve the clot once your injury has healed. With a blood clotting disorder, clots can form when you don't have an obvious injury or don't dissolve when they should. These conditions can be very serious and even life-threatening. A D-dimer test can show if you have one of these conditions. Other names: fragment D-dimer, fibrin degradation fragment1What is it used for? A D-dimer test is used to find out if you have a blood clotting disorder. These disorders include: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that's deep inside a vein. These clots usually affect the lower legs, but they can also happen in other parts of the body. Pulmonary embolism (PE), a blockage in an artery in the lungs. It usually happens when a blood clot in another part of the body breaks loose and travels to the lungs. DVT clots are a common cause of PE. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a condition that causes too many blood clots to form. They can form throughout the body, causing organ damage and other serious complications. DIC may be caused by traumatic injuries or certain types of infections or cancer. Stroke, a blockage in the blood supply to the brain.1Why do I need a D-dimer test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a blood clotting disorder, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE). Symptoms of DVT include: Leg pain or tenderness Leg swelling Redness or red streaks on the legs Symptoms of PE include: Trouble breathing Cough Chest pain Rapid heartbeat This test is often done in an emergency room or other health care setting. If you have DVT symptoms and are not in a health care setting, call your health care provider. If you have symptoms of PE, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention.1What happens during a D-dimer test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a D-dimer test.1Are there any risks to a D-dimer test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show low or normal D-dimer levels in the blood, it means you probably don't have a clotting disorder.  If your results show higher than normal levels of D-dimer, it may mean you have a clotting disorder. But it cannot show where the clot is located or what type of clotting disorder you have. Also, high D-dimer levels are not always caused by clotting problems. Other conditions that can cause high D-dimer levels include pregnancy, heart disease, and recent surgery. If your D-dimer results were not normal, your provider will probably order more tests to make a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a D-dimer test? If your D-dimer test results were not normal, your provider may order one or more imaging tests to find out if you have a clotting disorder. These include: Doppler ultrasound, a test that uses sound waves to create images of your veins. CT angiography. In this test, you are injected with a special dye that helps your blood vessels show up on a special type of x-ray machine. Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan. These are two tests that may be done separately or together. They both use small amounts of radioactive substances to help a scanning machine see how well air and blood move through your lungs.1References American Heart Association [Internet].

Dengue fever is a viral infection spread to people through bites from infected mosquitos. You can't catch the virus from a person who is sick with dengue fever. A dengue fever test checks a sample of your blood to see if you have the virus. The test is used if you have symptoms of dengue fever and have been in an area where mosquitos carry the virus. The dengue virus is most common in parts of the world with tropical and subtropical climates, including: South and Central America The Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands Asia The Middle East The Pacific Islands Africa Outbreaks of dengue fever are rare in the U.S. mainland. But small outbreaks have been reported in parts of Florida and Texas. Most people who get the dengue virus won't become sick. People who do get sick may have mild to severe symptoms that usually begin four to ten days after a bite from an infected mosquito. The most common symptom is a sudden high fever. There is no specific medicine that can cure or treat dengue fever, but most people will recover after about a week. Some people who get sick with dengue will develop severe dengue disease. Severe dengue can cause internal bleeding and shock, which can be life-threatening. Infants and pregnant women have a higher risk for developing severe dengue. The risk is also higher for people who have had dengue and then get it again. That's why it's so important to get a dengue fever test if you have symptoms after being in an area where the virus is common. There are two main types of dengue fever blood tests: Antibody tests check your blood sample for proteins, called antibodies, that your immune system makes to fight viruses and other germs. Your body needs time to make specific antibodies to fight dengue. So, these tests are most accurate when they are done four days or more after your symptoms begin. Molecular tests look for genetic material from the dengue virus in your blood sample. A PCR test (polymerase chain reaction) is a type of molecular test that's used to check for dengue. These tests can be done during the first seven days after your symptoms begin. Tests done later than that may not have accurate results. One type of PCR test can check for dengue along with two other viruses that mosquitos carry. These viruses, chikungunya and zika, are common in the same places as the dengue virus, and they cause similar symptoms. Your provider can order this test from your state or local public health department. Other names: dengue virus antibody, dengue virus by PCR1What is it used for? A dengue fever test is used to find out if you have the dengue virus. It is mostly used for people who have symptoms related to dengue fever and have recently traveled to an area where dengue infections are common.1Why do I need a dengue fever test? You may need to be tested for the dengue virus if you have symptoms of dengue fever and have been in an area where the virus is common. Symptoms usually show up four to ten days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms of dengue fever include a sudden high fever (104°F or higher) with any of these other symptoms: Nausea and vomiting Rash Eye pain, typically behind the eyes Headache Joint, bone or muscle pain Symptoms of severe dengue may begin 24 to 48 hours after the fever has gone away. Get medical help right away if you or a family member has any of these warning signs of severe dengue: Abdominal (belly) pain or tenderness Vomiting (at least 3 times in 24 hours) Bleeding from the nose or gums Vomiting blood or blood in stool (poop) Feeling tired, restlessness, or irritable1What happens during a dengue fever test? Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and your recent travels. If an infection is suspected, you will get a blood test to check for the dengue virus. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a dengue fever test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you had a molecular test (a PCR test): A positive test result means that the test found genetic material from the virus in your blood sample. You most likely have a dengue infection. A negative test result means that the dengue virus wasn't found in your blood sample. You probably don't have dengue. But it's possible that there wasn't enough virus in your blood sample for the test to find. That might happen if the test was done more than seven days after your symptoms began. If your molecular test result is negative, your provider will usually order an antibody test to confirm that you don't have dengue. If you had an antibody test, your test results may be reported as positive or negative. Or they may be given as a measurement of the dengue antibodies found in your blood sample. A positive test result means that antibodies for the dengue virus were found. You probably have a dengue infection, but you may need another test to confirm the results. That's because the antibody test may have found antibodies that fight other similar viruses that mosquitos carry. Your provider may order another type of blood test to find out exactly which type of viral infection you have. A negative test result means that dengue antibodies weren't found in your blood sample. Dengue may not be causing your symptoms. But a negative result could mean that you were tested before your body had time to make enough antibodies to show on the test. So, your provider may order another antibody test to check again. If you have dengue fever, your provider can tell you how to treat your symptoms. Always follow your provider's instructions. In general, care for dengue fever includes: Getting plenty of rest. Drinking lots of fluids. Taking acetaminophen to control fever and relieve pain. Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium, because they can increase the risk of bleeding. Watching carefully for symptoms of severe dengue. Dengue fever can become severe within hours. Get medical help right away if you develop the symptoms of severe dengue. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a dengue fever test? A vaccine is available for children ages 9 to 16 who: Have already had dengue fever. The vaccine helps protect against future dengue infections or from getting severe dengue disease. Before getting the vaccine, a child must have a blood test to confirm a past dengue infection. That's because the vaccine can be harmful to a child who has never had dengue fever. Live in areas where dengue is common. These areas include Puerto Rico, the U.S, Virgin Islands, the U.S. territories of American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The vaccine isn't approved for children traveling to these areas to visit. If you travel to an area where dengue is common, you can reduce the risk of infection by preventing mosquito bites.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

When you see your dentist for a checkup, the visit usually includes three parts: A dental cleaning to remove the buildup of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that coats your teeth X-rays of your teeth on certain visits, depending on the health of your teeth An exam of your teeth and mouth by a dentist Dental exams are important for protecting your oral health. Oral health includes your teeth, gums, and all the muscles and bones that let you smile, speak, and chew. Common oral health problems, such as include tooth decay (cavities) and gum disease (periodontal disease), can lead to pain, infection, and tooth loss. Poor oral health can affect your general health, too. For example, loosing teeth can cause problems with eating and nutrition, which can lead to other health problems. You can help prevent oral health problems with regular visits to the dentist and good toothbrushing and flossing habits at home. At a dental checkup, you'll usually see both a dentist and a dental hygienist. A dentist is a doctor who has special training to care for teeth and gums. A dental hygienist is a health care professional trained to clean teeth and teach you how to take good care of your teeth and gums. Dentists can treat people of all ages. There are also pediatric dentists who have received additional training on dental care for children. Other names: dental checkup, oral exam, oral hygiene, dental hygiene, dental prophylaxis1What is it used for? Dental exams are used to: Clean teeth to help prevent tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health problems Find problems early when they're easier to treat Help people learn the best ways to care for their oral health1Why do I need a dental exam? Ask your dentist or hygienist how often you should have exams. Most adults and children need to have a routine dental exam every six months. You may need more frequent dental exams if you: Have gum disease Get a lot of cavities Have a family history of oral health problems Have a health condition that may increase your risk for oral health problems, such as:

Diabetes
Heart disease
HIV
Conditions that affect your immune system

 Diabetes Heart disease HIV Conditions that affect your immune system Take medicines that make your mouth dry Smoke Are pregnant, which increases your risk for gum disease If you have swollen, dark red, and/or bleeding gums, tooth pain, or other discomfort in your mouth, don't wait for your routine dental exam. Contact your dentist as soon as possible. Babies should have their first dental appointment within six months of getting their first tooth, or by their first birthday. Ask your baby's dentist how often your baby should have a dental exam. Most babies should be checked every six months.1What happens during a dental exam? At a typical dental exam, a hygienist will clean your teeth. Then the dentist will examine your mouth. At certain visits, you may have x-rays of your teeth before the dentist examines you. Dental x-rays can show hidden cavities, gum disease, bone loss in your jaw, and other problems that can't be seen by looking in your mouth. Ask your dentist how often you need x-rays. For a dental cleaning: The first step is called "scaling." The hygienist will use small, metal tools to scrape plaque and tartar from your teeth:


Plaque is a film of bacteria that begins to coat your teeth soon after you eat. Brushing and flossing removes plaque, but not all of it. If you let plaque build up on your teeth, it can cause cavities and destroy the tissue and bone around your teeth, leading to tooth loss. Scaling gets rid of the plaque that tooth brushing leaves behind.
Tartar is a hard substance that can form over time from plaque that's not removed from your teeth. Tartar can build up along your gumline and cause red, swollen gums (gingivitis). This can lead to more serious gum infections and tooth loss. Only a professional dental scaling can remove tartar. And regular professional dental cleanings can prevent it from forming.

And regular professional dental cleanings can prevent it from forming. Next the hygienist will polish your teeth, using a device like an electric toothbrush with a rubber tip. The polishing is done with a special paste that's slightly gritty. After the polishing, the hygienist will floss your teeth. When needed, the hygienist may apply a fluoride gel or foam, or dental sealants to your teeth:


Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay (cavities). Fluoride treatments are given to children more often than adults.
Sealants are thin coatings painted on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. They can help prevent cavities for many years by keeping food and bacteria out of the grooves in the teeth. Sealants are mostly used in children and teens. But adults who have never had cavities in their back teeth may also choose to protect those teeth with dental sealants.

Sealants are mostly used in children and teens. But adults who have never had cavities in their back teeth may also choose to protect those teeth with dental sealants. The hygienist or dentist may give you tips on how to care for your teeth and gums, including the right way to brush and floss. If dental x-rays are needed: Your upper body will be covered with a heavy lead apron to protect you from radiation. You'll bite down on a piece of plastic and an x-ray scanner will be positioned near your cheek. The hygienist will leave the room or stand behind a protective shield to take the x-ray, which only takes a few seconds. You'll repeat these steps a few times to get x-rays of all your teeth. For the dentist's exam: If you had x-rays, your dentist will check them for problems. Next, your dentist will:


Examine your teeth and gums.
Check your bite, which is the way your top and bottom teeth fit together. If you have a bite problem, you may be referred to an orthodontist.
Check you for oral cancer. This involves looking and feeling for unusual lumps in your mouth, including on your lips and tongue. Your dentist may also check your face and neck.

Your dentist may also check your face and neck.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a dental exam? If you have certain health conditions, you may need to take antibiotics before your exam to prevent infections. Ask your dentist and/or your health care provider whether you need antibiotics, especially if you have heart problems or an immune system disorder. Some people feel anxious about going to the dentist. If you or your child feels this way, tell your dentist before your visit. Your dentist can discuss ways to help you feel more relaxed about getting dental care.1Are there any risks to a dental exam? There is very little risk to having a dental exam. The cleaning may be uncomfortable, but it's usually not painful. Dental x-rays are safe for most people. The dose of radiation in an x-ray is very low. But x-rays are not recommended during pregnancy, unless it's an emergency. Be sure to tell your dentist if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.1What do the results mean? After your dental exam, your dentist will discuss any oral health problems you may have and your treatment options. For certain problems, improving your brushing and flossing habits may be all that's needed. If you or your child has a cavity or a more serious problem, you'll probably need to make another appointment with the dentist to treat it. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a dental exam? You can help keep your teeth for your lifetime by getting regular dental exams and taking good care of your teeth and gums. For a healthy mouth and strong teeth: Brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled brush and toothpaste with fluoride. Clean between your teeth regularly using dental floss, a special brush, or a plastic pick. Your dentist can suggest the best way to do this. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months. Eat a healthy diet and limit sweets and sugary drinks. If you do have sweets, brush your teeth soon afterwards. Drink fluoridated water. Don't smoke. Smoking increases your risk for gum disease.1References HealthyChildren.org [Internet]. Itaska (IL): American Academy of Pediatrics; c2023.

It's a standard set of questions that you answer to help your health care provider find out whether you have depression. Depression is a common, serious mental health condition. Everyone feels sad at times, but depression is different than normal sadness or grief. Depression can affect how you think, feel, and behave. It makes it hard to function at home and work. You may lose interest in activities you once enjoyed. Some people with depression may feel worthless and might even think about harming themselves. Depression may also be part of other mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder. Because depression is a common mental health problem, depression screening is often done as part of a routine health checkup. Medical experts recommend that depression screening should be done for everyone starting at age 12. Screening can help find depression early. And treating depression early may make recovery faster. Most people with depression will get better. Other names: depression test, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS and GDS-SF)1What is it used for? A depression screening is used to: Help diagnose depression Understand how severe depression may be Help figure out what type of depression you have There are different types of depression. The most common types are: Major depression, also called major depressive disorder. The symptoms typically make it difficult to work, sleep, study and eat. With major depression, you have symptoms most of the time for at least two weeks. Persistent depressive disorder, also called dysthymia. The symptoms are less severe than major depression, but they last much longer, usually for at least two years. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). This form of depression usually happens in winter when there's less sunlight. Most people with SAD tend to feel better in the spring and summer. Postpartum depression. This is major depression that happens after giving birth. It's more severe and lasts longer than mild unhappiness and other mood changes that are often called the "baby blues." Major depression may also begin during pregnancy. Depression that happens during or shortly after pregnancy is called "perinatal depression." Medical experts recommend routine depression screening during pregnancy and after birth.1Why do I need depression screening? Depression screening is often part of a routine checkup. You may also need depression screening if you show signs of depression, which may include: Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy Feeling sad or anxious Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness Trouble sleeping (insomnia) or sleeping too much Fatigue and lack of energy Trouble concentrating, remembering details, or making decisions Changes in your weight Thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide If you are thinking about suicide or hurting yourself, get help right away: Call 911 or go to your local emergency room Contact a suicide hotline.

During a depression screening, you'll answer a standard set of questions. Your provider may ask the questions, or you may fill out a questionnaire form to discuss with your provider later. In general, the questions ask you about:  Changes you've noticed in your:

Mood
Sleep habits
Appetite or weight
Energy levels
Ability to focus your attention
Stress levels

 Mood Sleep habits Appetite or weight Energy levels Ability to focus your attention Stress levels Medicines you take Alcohol and drug use Your personal and family history of depression and other mental health conditions You may also have a physical exam. There's no lab test that can diagnose depression. But your provider may order blood tests to find out if another health condition, such as anemia or thyroid disease, may be causing depression. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. If you are being tested by a mental health provider, he or she may ask you more detailed questions about your feelings and behaviors. You may also be asked to fill out a questionnaire about these issues.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for depression screening? You usually don't need any special preparations for a depression test or a blood test.1Are there any risks to depression screening?  There is no risk to answering questions or having a physical exam. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you are diagnosed with depression, your provider will discuss your treatment options. Starting treatment as soon as possible may improve your chance of recovery. Treatment for depression may take time to work, but it can help reduce symptoms and shorten how long depression lasts. Your provider may suggest that you see a mental health provider for your care. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. If you are already seeing a mental health provider, a depression test may help guide your treatment. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about depression screening? There are many types of mental health providers who treat depression. Your primary health care provider can help you find the right support. These are some of the professionals who have training to diagnose and treat depression: Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in mental health. Psychiatrists can prescribe medicine. Psychologists generally have doctoral degrees, but they do not have medical degrees. They can't prescribe medicine unless they have a special license. Some psychologists work with providers who can prescribe medicine. Psychologists may use one-on-one counseling and/or group therapy sessions. Psychiatric or mental health nurses are nurses with special training in mental health problems. Nurses who may have a master's or doctoral degree in psychiatric-mental health nursing include, advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), certified nurse practitioners (CNPs), and clinical nurse specialists (CNSs). In some states, certain nurses can prescribe medicines. Licensed clinical social workers have at least a master's degree in social work with special training in mental health. They can't prescribe medicine, but they may work with providers who can prescribe medicine. Providers who are licensed clinical social workers usually have LCSW or LICSW after their names. Licensed professional counselors (LPC) may also be called clinicians or therapists. States have different names of these licenses, such as LMFT (licensed marriage and family therapist). These professionals usually have a master's degree in a field related to mental health. They can't prescribe medicine, but may work with providers who can prescribe.1References American Psychiatric Association [Internet]. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Association; c2022.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/ty6747 Developmental and Behavioral Screening Tests : 1What are developmental and behavioral screening tests? Developmental and behavioral screening tests look at how a child is developing. The screenings are made up of checklists and questionnaires for parents. They include questions about their child's language, movement, thinking, behavior, and emotions. Many of the questions are based on developmental milestones. Developmental milestones are skills and behaviors that show up in babies and children at certain ages as they grow. They include smiling for the first time, rolling over, and walking. The screening compares your child's milestones to those of other children of the same age. If the screening shows your child is developing at a slower rate, it may be a sign of a developmental disability. Developmental disabilities are conditions that cause problems in physical and/or mental functions. They include: Intellectual disabilities (ID). These conditions cause below average mental abilities. People with ID often have problems with learning and daily living skills. Autism spectrum disorder. This is a disorder that affects behavior, communication, and social skills. Cerebral palsy. This is a condition that affects movement, coordination, and balance. Deafness or other hearing problems Developmental and behavioral screening tests don't diagnose these conditions. But a screening can show if your child is not developing on schedule. When developmental disabilities are found and treated early, it can make a big impact on a child's life. Early treatment, known as early intervention, helps children learn important skills, make the most of their strengths, and improve their quality of life. Other names: Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS), Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), Child Development Inventories (CDI)1What are they used for? Developmental and behavioral screening tests are used to see if a child is meeting his or her developmental milestones. Below are some examples of milestones for infants and toddlers. Birth to 4 months Includes smiling, cooing, and bringing hands to mouth. 6 months. Includes playing with others, looking at themselves in the mirror, sitting without support, and rolling over. 9 months. Includes making sounds like "mama" and "dada," understanding the word "no," crawling, and pulling to a stand. 1 year. Includes playing peekaboo, following simple directions, and walking while holding on to furniture. 18 months. Includes speaking and understanding several words, eating with a spoon, walking, and walking up and down stairs. 2 to 3 years. Includes recognizing labels and colors, naming pictures of common objects, getting dressed and undressed, and walking and running easily. Developmental milestones are general guidelines. Children grow at different rates. There is a range in what is considered normal development. But looking at milestones can help identify potential problems early.1Why does my child need a developmental and behavioral screening test? The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screenings for all children during regular well-child checkups at the following ages: 9 months 18 months 30 months The AAP also recommends that all children should be screened for autism spectrum disorder during regular checkups at 18 and 24 months. Also, talk to your provider about a screening if you think there is a problem with your child's development. As a parent, you will probably be the first to notice any problems with the way your child interacts, learns, speaks, or moves.1What happens during a development and behavioral screening test? Screenings may be done by your child's provider and/or by you with guidance from your child's provider. There are many different types of developmental and behavioral screening tests. Each asks questions about a child's development. You may be asked about your child's social interactions, language skills, and/or gross and fine motor skills. Motor skills are the ability to move muscles. Gross motor skills involve moving large muscles for movements such as walking and jumping. Fine motor skills are the ability to move small muscles with precision, such as picking up a toy or using a fork. Common tests include: Ages and Stages Questionnaire. This test is designed for children between the ages of 1 month and 5 1/2 years. It contains a series of questions with answer choices of "yes," "sometimes," and "not yet." Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS). This test is designed for children from birth to age 8. It is a brief test that can be completed in about five minutes. Child Development Inventories (CDI). These are three different tests. They are geared to age groups from infancy to preschool. Each contains 60 yes or no questions. Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT). This test is for toddlers between the ages of 16 and 30 months. It includes a series of yes or no questions.1Are there any special preparations needed for this screening? There are no special preparations needed for this screening.1Are there any risks to the screening? There is no risk in taking a questionnaire.1What do the results mean? If the results show that your child is not developing at the same rate as other children of the same age, it doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem. But your child may be referred to specialist for further testing and treatment. If you have questions about the results, talk to your child's provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about developmental and behavioral screening tests? If screening tests show a problem with your child's development, your child's provider may recommend at-home developmental monitoring. Developmental monitoring is a way to look at how your child grows and changes over time. Parents and other caregivers use brief checklists to track the child's development.1References Center for Parent Information and Resources [Internet].

DHEAS stands for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. DHEAS is a male sex hormone that is found in both men and women. DHEAS plays an important role in making the male sex hormone testosterone and the female sex hormone estrogen. It’s also involved in the development of male sexual characteristics at puberty. DHEAS is mostly made in the adrenal glands, two small glands located above your kidneys. They help control heart rate, blood pressure, and other body functions. Smaller amounts of DHEAS are made in a man’s testicles and in a woman’s ovaries. If your DHEAS levels are not normal, it may mean there is a problem with your adrenal glands or sex organs (testicles or ovaries.) Other names:  DHEAS, DHEA-S, DHEA, DHEA-SO4, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate1What is it used for? A DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) test is most often used to: Find out if your adrenal glands are working right Diagnose tumors of the adrenal glands Diagnose disorders of the testicles or ovaries Find out the cause of early puberty in boys Find out the cause of excess body hair growth and development of masculine features in women and girls A DHEAS test is often done along with other sex hormone tests. These include testosterone tests for men and estrogen tests for women.1Why do I need a DHEA sulfate test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of high levels or low levels of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS). Men may not have any symptoms of high levels of DHEAS. Symptoms of high levels of DHEAS in women and girls may include: Excess body and facial hair growth Deepening of voice Menstrual irregularities Acne Increased muscularity Hair loss at the top of the head Babies may also need testing if they have genitals that are not clearly male or female in appearance (ambiguous genitalia). Boys may need this test if they have signs of early puberty. Symptoms of low levels of DHEAS may include the following signs of an adrenal gland disorder: Unexplained weight loss Nausea and vomiting Dizziness Dehydration Craving for salt Other symptoms of low DHEAS are related to aging and may include: Decreased sex drive Erectile dysfunction in men Thinning of vaginal tissues in women1What happens during a DHEA sulfate test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don’t need any special preparations for a DHEA sulfate test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show high levels of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, an inherited disorder of the adrenal glands A tumor of the adrenal gland. It may be benign (noncancerous) or cancerous. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormone disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility. If your results show low levels of DHEAS, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Addison disease. Addison disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands are not able to make enough of certain hormones. Hypopituitarism, a condition in which the pituitary gland does not make enough pituitary hormones  If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a DHEA sulfate test? DHEA sulfate levels normally decline with age in both men and women. Over-the-counter DHEA sulfate supplements are available and are sometimes promoted as an anti-aging therapy. But there is no reliable evidence to support these anti-aging claims. In fact, these supplements may cause serious side effects. If you have questions about DHEA supplements, talk to your health care provider.1References Kids Health from Nemours [Internet]. Jacksonville (FL): The Nemours Foundation; c1995–2020.

 Diabetes Tests : 1What are diabetes tests? Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease that affects how your body uses glucose (blood sugar). Glucose is your body's main source of energy. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin or insulin doesn't work like it should. This can cause glucose levels to get too high, which can lead to serious health problems. These include heart disease, nerve damage, eye problems, and kidney disease. Diabetes tests measure glucose levels in blood or urine to see if you are at risk for or have diabetes. Other names: blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose, FPG, oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT, glucose screening test, glucose in urine test, hemoglobin A1c, random blood sugar1What are they used for? Diabetes tests are used to screen for and/or diagnose the following: Type 1 diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin at all. This condition happens when your immune system attacks and destroys cells that produce insulin. It can develop at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. People with type 1 diabetes must take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or a special pump Type 2 diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but the cells in your body don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood. Type 2 diabetes may be caused by your genes and lifestyle factors, such as being overweight or having obesity. The condition most often occurs in adulthood but is becoming more common in children and teens. Gestational diabetes. This is a form of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy. Prediabetes. This is a condition in which your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. But it may put you at risk for getting diabetes.1Why do I need a diabetes test? You may need testing if you have symptoms of diabetes, such as: Increased thirst Frequent urination Increased hunger Fatigue Blurred vision Unexplained weight loss Sores that are slow to heal Numbness or tingling in the feet Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes often develop slowly, even over the course of years. Gestational diabetes doesn't usually cause symptoms in the early stages of pregnancy, but most pregnant women are screened for the condition. If testing shows glucose levels are high, you will be tested again to confirm the diagnosis. You may also need testing if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk for diabetes if you: Are over 45 years old. The American Diabetes Association recommends annual diabetes screening for all adults aged 45 years and older. Have prediabetes Are overweight or obese Have a family history of diabetes Have high blood pressure or heart disease Previously had gestational diabetes1What happens during a diabetes test? There are several ways to screen for and diagnose diabetes. Most tests involve measuring glucose levels in the blood. To get a blood sample, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. The different types of glucose blood tests include: Blood glucose test, also known as fasting blood glucose. Before the test, you will need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test. This test is often used as a screening test for diabetes. It may be repeated to confirm a diagnosis. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This test also requires fasting before the test. When you arrive for your test, a blood sample will be taken. You will then drink a sugary liquid that contains glucose. About two hours later, another blood sample will be taken. Random blood sugar. This test can be taken at any time. No fasting is required. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). This test measures the average amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin over the past 3 months. Hemoglobin is the part of your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. No fasting is required for this test. Glucose may also be measured in urine. Urine tests are not used to diagnose diabetes but may show if you are at risk for getting the disease. If your glucose in urine levels are higher than normal, you will probably need a blood test to confirm the diagnosis. For a glucose in urine test, your provider may recommend an at-home test kit. The kit will include a test strip that you hold under your stream of urine. The test strip will change colors to show different levels of glucose.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You will need to fast (not eat or drink) for a blood glucose and an oral glucose tolerance test. You don't need any special preparations for a random blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, or glucose in urine test.1Are there any risks to this test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a urine test.1What do the results mean? Depending on the type of test or tests you had, your results may show one of the following: Normal glucose levels. This means you probably are not at risk for or do not have diabetes. Prediabetes. This means you have higher than normal glucose levels and may be at risk for getting diabetes. Type 1 or type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes If you have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, talk to your provider about how to best manage the condition. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes, but it may be controlled with regular glucose monitoring and taking insulin. If you've been diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, your condition may be managed or even reversed by taking diabetes medicines and making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, losing weight, and increasing exercise. If you've been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But be sure to talk to your provider about treatment options. Most of the time, gestational diabetes goes away after giving birth. If you have other questions about your diabetes diagnosis or treatment, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about diabetes testing? If you've been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you will need to monitor blood glucose levels daily, often several times a day. Your health care provider can recommend a kit you can use at home. Most kits include a lancet, a device that pricks your finger. You will use this to collect a drop of blood for testing. There are some newer kits available that don't require pricking your finger. Some pregnant women with gestational diabetes may also need to monitor their glucose levels in this way. People with type 2 diabetes will also have to check their blood sugar on a regular basis. If you have type 2 diabetes, talk to your provider about how often it should be checked. People with type 2 diabetes may also need to have their insulin levels checked regularly. Insulin plays a key role in keeping glucose at the right levels. An insulin in blood test is done at a provider's office.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet].

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/diabetes-mellitus-overview-5074551 Diabetic Foot Exam : 1What is a diabetic foot exam? People with diabetes have a high risk for many types of foot health problems. A diabetic foot exam can help find problems that can lead to serious infection and amputation (surgery to remove all or part of your foot) if they're not found and treated early. Diabetic foot problems can happen over time if high blood glucose (blood sugar) damages the nerves and blood vessels in your feet. Nerve damage from diabetes is called diabetic neuropathy. It can make your feet feel numb or tingly. It can also cause you to lose feeling in your feet. If you don't feel pain in your feet, you may not notice a callus, blister, or cut on your foot. Without treatment, these types of common foot wounds can become ulcers (open sores) that can get infected. If you have diabetes, a foot sore or infection may not heal well, even with treatment. That's because diabetes can damage blood vessels and cause poor blood flow in your feet. If an infection doesn't get better, tissue in your foot may die. This is called gangrene. If you have gangrene or an infection that won't heal, your toe, foot, or part of your leg may need to be amputated to prevent infection from spreading and to save your life. Fortunately, you can help keep your feet healthy by: Getting regular diabetic foot exams Caring for your feet at home Keeping your blood sugar within a range that's healthy for you Other names: comprehensive foot exam1What is it used for? A diabetic foot exam is used to find foot health problems in people with diabetes before they cause serious infection. The exam is used to check the feet for: Problems with the nerves and blood flow. Signs of damage or injury. Changes in shape. Foot changes, such as bunions and hammer toes (toes that curve upwards with the top part curled under), can make shoes rub and cause foot ulcers.1Why do I need a diabetic foot exam? People with diabetes usually need to have a complete diabetic foot exam at least once a year to help prevent serious infections. But if you've had foot problems from diabetes, you may need to have a complete foot exam more often. A complete foot exam may be done by your primary care provider or a foot doctor (podiatrist). A foot doctor specializes in keeping feet healthy and treating foot diseases. Ask the provider you see for foot care to tell you how often you need a complete foot exam. It's also a good idea to ask your primary care provider to do a quick check of your feet at every health care visit you have during the year. If you're meeting your diabetes treatment goals, your provider will probably want to see you at least twice a year to check your health and review your self-care plan. Make sure to have your feet checked, too. If you have any of these foot symptoms, contact your provider right away: A blister, cut, bruise, or other foot injury that doesn't start to heal after a few days. Skin on your foot that is red, warm, or painful. These are signs of a possible infection. A callus with dried blood inside it. This may be the first sign of a wound under the callus. A foot infection that becomes black and smelly. This may be a sign of gangrene.1What happens during a diabetic foot exam? A complete diabetic foot exam usually includes these steps: Information about you. Your provider will ask questions about: Your medical history. This includes how you're managing your diabetes, other conditions you may have, and your symptoms. The medicines you take. Your shoes. Your provider may check your shoes for proper fit and ask questions about your other footwear. Shoes that don't fit well can lead to blisters, calluses, and ulcers. Skin exam. Your provider will check: The skin of your feet to look for dryness, cracking, calluses, blisters, ulcers, and other damage or abnormal areas Your toenails for cracks and fungal infection The temperature of your feet to see if they are the same Nerve exam. Your provider will do a few tests to check your nerves and the feeling in your feet: Monofilament test. You will close your eyes while your provider brushes a soft strand of nylon (a monofilament) over your foot and toes. You'll tell your provider when you feel the strand touching your foot. Tuning fork and vibration perception threshold tests (VPT). Your provider will place a tuning fork or other device that vibrates on different parts of your foot and toes to see if you can feel the vibrations. Pinprick test. Your provider will gently press a small pin against your big toe to see if you can feel it. The pin will not break through your skin. Ankle reflexes. Your provider will tap a special, small hammer on your Achilles tendon, the thick band of tissue that connects your calf muscle to your heel bone. If your nerves are working properly, your foot will jerk slightly on its own. Musculoskeletal (muscle and bone) exam. Your provider will look for problems such as: Bent or overlapping toes Bunions A rocker shape on the bottom of your foot (Charcot Foot) Vascular (blood vessel) exam. To check blood flow to your feet, your provider may: Feel the pulses in your foot and ankle Compare blood pressure measurements in your ankles and arms. If blood pressure in your ankle is lower than in your arm, you may have reduced blood flow to your foot. This is called an ankle-brachial index test. Your provider may do this test if you have signs and symptoms of a blood flow problem.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a diabetic foot exam.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a diabetic foot exam.1What do the results mean? Your provider will use the results of your exam to estimate your risk of developing foot ulcers and infections that could lead to amputation. If your risk is high, your provider will probably recommend that you have a complete diabetic foot exam more than once a year. If a problem is found that needs medical care, your treatment will depend on the type of problem and how serious it is. If you have questions about your diabetic foot exam, ask your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a diabetic foot exam? You can help keep your feet healthy by controlling your blood sugar levels every day and taking good care of your feet. This includes: Checking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too. Washing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes. Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So, you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers. Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you. Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble in your shoe could rub your skin raw. Protecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace. Keeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking. Getting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your provider look at your feet.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/uq2713 Differential Diagnosis : 1What is a differential diagnosis? Different health conditions often cause similar symptoms. For example, fatigue is a symptom that can be caused by anemia, depression, heart disease, thyroid disease, sleep disorders, and many other conditions. If you have fatigue or other symptoms that are linked to many conditions, your provider has to figure out which condition you have so that you get the right treatment. To make a diagnosis, your provider will follow a careful step-by-step process of ruling out conditions that share your symptoms until it's clear which condition is most likely the cause of your illness. This process is called making a differential diagnosis. An important step in making a differential diagnosis is to make a list of all the possible conditions that you might have. This is your differential diagnosis list. Your provider will base your list on your specific: Symptoms Medical history Family health history Test results A list of possible conditions helps your provider decide which tests will help confirm or rule out the conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Your test results help narrow your differential diagnosis list until it's clear which condition you have. This is your final diagnosis. The process of making a differential diagnosis may take time, but it helps make sure your provider doesn't miss a possible cause of your symptoms. That means your final diagnosis is more likely to be accurate and you'll get the right treatment.1How is it used? A differential diagnosis process is used to help make a final diagnosis when you have symptoms that don't have one clear cause. It can be used to help diagnose physical and mental disorders.1What happens during a differential diagnosis? To make a differential diagnosis, your provider has to think like a detective and follow several steps: The first step is to gather clues by asking you about your health. Your provider will ask detailed questions about your: Symptoms, such as:

How do your symptoms feel and how do they affect you?
When did they start and how long do they last?
What makes them better or worse?

 How do your symptoms feel and how do they affect you? When did they start and how long do they last? What makes them better or worse? Medical history. Your provider will consider whether your symptoms could be related to health problems you already have. Medicines and supplements. Sometimes symptoms can be side effects from medicines or supplements, so your provider will want to know about anything you take. Family health history. If a certain condition runs in your family, your provider will consider whether your symptoms are a sign of that condition. Life and habits. Changes or problems with your sleep, diet, exercise, work, mood, and relationships can be causes or symptoms of many conditions. The second step of the differential diagnosis process is a physical exam. Information from an exam gives your provider more clues about your health. It may help rule out certain conditions or make others seem more likely. The third step is to put together a differential diagnosis list.   Your provider will come up with a list of "suspects" -- the conditions that you may have based on information about your symptoms, health, and lifestyle. The fourth step is to order tests. Tests can help confirm or rule out the conditions on your differential diagnosis list. The tests you have will depend on the conditions on your list. If your list includes a serious condition that may need urgent treatment, you'll have tests for that condition first. Common tests to help narrow your differential diagnosis list may include: Lab tests, such as blood and urine (pee) tests A biopsy Imaging tests, such as an MRI scan, ultrasound, or x-ray A mental health screening if your symptoms could be caused by a mental disorder As test results rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, your final diagnosis should become clear. Then your provider can recommend treatment.1What do my results mean? The conditions on your differential diagnosis list are not your final diagnosis. They're the conditions that could cause symptoms like yours. If you have questions about these conditions, talk with your provider. Your provider will use the differential diagnosis list to choose which tests to order. Each time you get test results, ask your provider how they affect your differential diagnosis. Test results may help your provider decide to do other tests, or they may guide treatment choices. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a differential diagnosis? Your provider may recommend starting treatment before your final diagnosis is certain. That's because the goal of making a differential diagnosis is to narrow the possible causes of your symptoms until your provider can figure out which treatments are most likely to help you. In certain cases, your provider may learn more about your condition by seeing whether or not a treatment improves your symptoms. That information may help lead to a final diagnosis.1References Bosner F, Pickert J, Stibane T.

A Doppler ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to show blood moving through blood vessels. A regular ultrasound also uses sound waves to create images of structures inside the body, but it can't show blood flow. Doppler ultrasound works by measuring sound waves that are reflected from moving objects, such as red blood cells. This is known as the Doppler effect. There are different types of Doppler ultrasound tests. They include: Color Doppler. This type of Doppler uses a computer to change sound waves into different colors. These colors show the speed and direction of blood flow in real time. Power Doppler, a newer type of color Doppler. It can provide more detail of blood flow than standard color Doppler. But it cannot show the direction of blood flow, which can be important in some cases. Spectral Doppler. This test shows blood flow information on a graph, rather than color pictures. It can help show how much of a blood vessel is blocked. Duplex Doppler. This test uses standard ultrasound to take images of blood vessels and organs. Then a computer turns the images into a graph, as in spectral Doppler. Continuous wave Doppler. In this test, sound waves are sent and received continuously. It allows for more accurate measurement of blood that flows at faster speeds. Other names: Doppler ultrasonography1What is it used for? Doppler ultrasound tests are used to help health care providers find out if you have a condition that is reducing or blocking your blood flow. It may also be used to help diagnose certain heart diseases. The test is most often used to: Check heart function. It is often done along with an electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical signals in the heart. Look for blockages in blood flow. Blocked blood flow in the legs can cause a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Check for blood vessel damage and for defects in the structure of the heart. Look for narrowing of blood vessels. Narrowed arteries in arms and legs can mean you have condition called peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Narrowing of arteries in the neck can mean you have a condition called carotid artery stenosis. Monitor blood flow after surgery. Check for normal blood flow in a pregnant woman and her unborn baby.1Why do I need a Doppler ultrasound? You may need a Doppler ultrasound if you have symptoms of reduced blood flow or a heart disease. Symptoms vary depending on the condition causing the problem. Some common blood flow conditions and symptoms are below. Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) include: Numbness or weakness in your legs Painful cramping in your hips or leg muscles when walking or climbing stairs Cold feeling in your lower leg or foot Change in color and/or shiny skin on your leg Symptoms of heart problems include: Shortness of breath Swelling in your legs, feet, and/or abdomen Fatigue You may also need a Doppler ultrasound if you: Have had a stroke. After a stroke, your health care provider may order a special kind of Doppler test, called transcranial Doppler, to check blood flow to the brain. Had an injury to your blood vessels. Are being treated for a blood flow disorder. Are pregnant and your provider thinks you or your unborn baby might have a blood flow problem. Your provider may suspect a problem if your unborn baby is smaller than it should be at this stage of pregnancy or if you have certain health problems. These include sickle cell disease or preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure that affects pregnant women.1What happens during a Doppler ultrasound? A Doppler ultrasound usually includes the following steps: You will lie a table, exposing the area of your body that's being tested. A health care provider will spread a special gel on the skin over that area. The provider will move a wand-like device, called a transducer, over the area. The device sends sound waves into your body. The movement of blood cells causes a change in the pitch of the sound waves. You may hear swishing or pulse-like sounds during the procedure. The waves are recorded and turned into images or graphs on a monitor. After the test is over, the provider will wipe the gel off your body. The test takes about 30-60 minutes to complete.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? To prepare for a Doppler ultrasound, you may need to: Remove clothing and jewelry from the area of the body that is getting tested. Avoid cigarettes and other products that have nicotine for up to two hours before your test. Nicotine causes blood vessels to narrow, which can affect your results. For certain types of Doppler tests, you may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a Doppler ultrasound. It is also considered safe during pregnancy.1What do the results mean? If your results were not normal, it may mean you have: A blockage or clot in an artery Narrowed blood vessels Abnormal blood flow An aneurysm, a balloon-like bulge in the arteries. It causes the arteries to become stretched and thin. If the wall becomes too thin, the artery can rupture, causing life-threatening bleeding. Results may also show if there is abnormal blood flow in an unborn baby. The meaning of your results will depend what area of the body was being tested. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1References Johns Hopkins Medicine [Internet]. The Johns Hopkins University; c2020.

Down syndrome is a condition in which a person is born with an extra chromosome or an extra piece of a chromosome. The condition causes problems with development, thinking, learning, and physical health. Down syndrome tests can help find this chromosome disorder in unborn babies. Chromosomes are tiny "packages" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. Normally, you're born with a set of 46 chromosomes in each cell. The chromosomes are grouped into 23 pairs. Each pair has two chromosomes, one coming from each parent. Most people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in all their cells. This common form of Down syndrome is called trisomy 21. "Trisomy" means having three copies of a chromosome in your cells instead of the usual two. With less common types of Down syndrome, a person may have: An extra piece of chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome (translocation Down syndrome) An extra chromosome 21 in some, but not all of their cells (mosaic Down syndrome) The extra chromosome affects the way a baby's brain and body develop. The symptoms may range from mild to severe. Children with Down syndrome usually have some problems with thinking and learning. They may start talking later than other children. Common physical signs of Down syndrome include a flat face, eyes that slant up, a short neck, small hands and feet, poor muscle tone, and loose joints. Common health problems in childhood include hearing loss, sleep apnea, ear infections, eye diseases, and heart defects. There are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy: Prenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome. If a screening test shows that your baby could have Down syndrome, you'll need another test to find out for sure. There are a few types of screening tests for Down syndrome:


First trimester screening includes:


A blood test to check your blood for "markers" such as certain proteins that may be linked to a higher risk of Down syndrome
An ultrasound image to look for fluid in the back of the baby's neck, which may be a sign of Down syndrome


Second trimester screening includes blood tests to check the levels of several markers in your blood that may be a sign of Down syndrome. The test may check three markers (a triple screen test) or four markers (a quadruple screen test).
Combined (or integrated) testing uses results from both first and second trimester screening tests to estimate your baby's risk for Down syndrome.
Cell-free fetal DNA is a newer test that checks a sample of your blood for unusually large amounts of material from chromosome 21. This test can be done as early as ten weeks. But it's not recommended if you:


Have a low risk of having a baby with Down syndrome
Are pregnant with two or more babies.

 Have a low risk of having a baby with Down syndrome Are pregnant with two or more babies. Prenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells. These tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage, so they're often done after a screening test shows that an unborn baby could have Down syndrome. Diagnostic tests for Down syndrome include:


Amniocentesis. This test takes a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the unborn baby in the uterus. The fluid contains cells from the baby that can be tested. The test is usually done between the weeks 15 and 20 of pregnancy.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). A CVS collects tissue from parts of the placenta called the chorionic villi. The placenta is the organ that grows in the uterus to provide nutrients and oxygen to the baby. Cells from the chorionic villi usually have the same chromosomes as the unborn baby. A CVS may be done between weeks 10 and 13 of pregnancy.
Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), also called cordocentesis. This test removes a sample of the baby's blood from the umbilical cord. PUBS gives the most accurate diagnosis of Down syndrome during pregnancy, but it's not commonly used. That's because it has more risks than other tests and it can't be done until later in pregnancy, usually between weeks 18 and 22.

Confirm a diagnosis of Down syndrome in an unborn baby.

 Estimate an unborn baby's risk of Down syndrome. Confirm a diagnosis of Down syndrome in an unborn baby. After birth to diagnose or rule out Down syndrome in a newborn that shows signs of the condition. Usually, a karyotype test is done on a sample of the baby's blood. This test checks the number and structure of the baby's chromosomes. As part of in vitro fertilization (IVF) to check embryos for chromosome problems before placing them in the uterus to start a pregnancy.1Why do I need a Down syndrome test? You may need Down syndrome testing during pregnancy if you have a high risk for having a baby with Down syndrome. Your risk may be higher if: You were age 35 or older when you got pregnant. The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome increases with age. You have a child with Down syndrome or had a diagnosis of Down syndrome in a past pregnancy. You have a family history of Down syndrome. An ultrasound of your unborn baby showed a possible sign of Down syndrome. You may choose to be tested even if you don't have a high risk for having a baby with Down syndrome. Your provider or a genetic counselor can help you consider the pros and cons of testing.1What happens during Down syndrome testing? For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For the first trimester ultrasound, a health care professional will move an ultrasound wand-like device on your belly. Ultrasound uses sound waves to make an image of your unborn baby. For amniocentesis, a provider inserts a hollow needle through your belly and into your uterus to withdraw a sample of amniotic fluid. For chorionic villus sampling (CVS), a provider collects a sample of tissue from the placenta with either a needle that's inserted through your belly or a tube that's inserted through your vagina. For percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), a provider inserts a hollow needle through your belly and into the umbilical cord in your uterus. A small blood sample is removed from a vein in the cord.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the tests? Blood tests and ultrasounds usually don't require any preparation. For a CVS or amniocentesis, you may need to drink extra fluid and not urinate before your test so that your bladder is full. If you're having a PUBS test after 23 weeks of pregnancy, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the tests? Blood tests and ultrasounds have very little risk. After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. During amniocentesis or CVS, you may feel mild stinging or cramping. Both tests are safe, but they do have a slight risk of causing a miscarriage. PUBS may cause brief discomfort. This test has a slightly higher risk of causing serious problems than amniocentesis or CVS. Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of testing for Down syndrome.1What do the results mean? Results from Down syndrome screening tests show your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome: A positive screening test result means that your baby's chance of having Down syndrome is higher than average. Your test results may include a number that describes how high the risk is. But a high risk doesn't mean your baby will have Down syndrome. You could still deliver a healthy baby with no chromosomal defects or disorders. A negative/normal screening test result means that your baby is unlikely to have Down syndrome. But a screening test can't guarantee that your baby won't have Down syndrome. Whether or not your screening tests were normal, you may choose to have one or more diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests can usually tell you whether or not your baby will have Down syndrome. But diagnostic tests cannot predict how much Down syndrome will affect your baby's health and abilities. You may find it helpful to speak with a genetic counselor before testing and again after you get your results. Genetic counselors are specially trained to help you weigh the risks and benefits of testing. They can also help you understand and what your results mean so you can make informed decisions.

A drug test looks for signs of one or more illegal or prescription drugs in a sample of your urine (pee), blood, saliva (spit), hair, or sweat. The purpose of a drug test is to look for drug use and misuse, which includes: Using any illegal drugs, such as cocaine or club drugs Misusing prescription medicines, which means taking prescription medicines in a different way or for a different purpose than your provider prescribed. Examples of drug misuse include using a prescription pain reliever to relax or taking someone else's prescription. A drug test can check for a single drug or for a group of drugs in your body. Drug tests commonly test for: Alcohol Amphetamines, including methamphetamine Barbiturates, such as phenobarbital and secobarbital Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam or clonazepam Cocaine Marijuana (THC) Opioids and opiates, such as heroin, codeine, oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl Phencyclidine (PCP) Steroids Most drug tests use urine samples. These tests can find signs of drugs within hours to several days or more before the test. How long a drug lasts in your body depends on: The type of drug How much you used How long you were using it before the test How your body reacts to the drug Other names: drug screen, drug test, drugs of abuse testing, substance abuse testing, toxicology screen, tox screen, sports doping tests1What is it used for? Drug testing is used to find out whether you have been using or misusing one or more drugs. But it can't diagnose a drug use disorder (addiction). A drug test may be used for different purposes, including: Employment. Employers may screen you for drugs before hiring you. After you're hired, they may test you to check for on-the-job drug use. If you have a work accident, you may be tested to see whether drugs or alcohol were involved. Sports. Professional and other athletes are often tested for drugs that are used to improve performance, such as steroids that help build muscle. Drug treatment. Drug testing may be used to monitor treatment in programs for drug or alcohol use disorder. Legal evidence. Testing may be part of a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation. Drug screening may also be ordered as part of a court case. Monitoring misuse of prescription drugs. If your provider prescribed a medicine that can be addictive, such as an opioid for long-term pain, your provider may order a drug test to make sure you're taking the medicine correctly. Drug testing may be scheduled ahead of time or done randomly without notice.1Why do I need a drug test? You may be asked to take a drug test for a job, to participate in certain organized sports, or as part of a police investigation or court case. In a hospital emergency room, a provider may order a drug test if you have signs of a possible drug overdose.1What happens during a drug test? Drug testing may be done in a variety of locations, including labs, hospitals, drug treatment centers, and workplaces. The most commonly used drug tests require that you give a urine sample. You will be given instructions for how to collect your sample. In certain cases, a health care professional or other person may need to be present while you provide your sample. This is to make sure the urine is yours and isn't contaminated with anything that might affect the test results. For a blood test for drugs, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Be sure to tell the testing professional if you are taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, or supplements, because these substances may affect your test results. Also, you should avoid foods with poppy seeds, which can show up as opiates in a drug test.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known physical risks to having a drug test. But if drugs show up in your results, it may affect your job, your eligibility to play sports, the outcome of a legal matter, or other parts of your life. Before you take a drug test, make sure you know: What you are being tested for Why you are being tested How the results will be used. If you have questions or concerns about a drug test, talk with your provider or the person or organization that is asking for the test.1What do the results mean? If a drug test result is negative, it means that either: The drugs that were tested were not found in the sample. A very small amount of drugs were found, but not enough to be a positive test result for drugs. If a drug test result is positive, it means that one or more drugs were found in amounts that suggest drug use or misuse. Positive tests require follow-up testing because they may be wrong (false positives). The follow-up test is usually a test that provides more accurate results. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a drug test? If you test positive for a legal drug prescribed by your doctor, your employer can't penalize you, unless the drug is affecting your ability to perform your job. If you test positive for marijuana and live in a state where it is legal, employers may still be able penalize you. Many employers want to maintain a drug-free workplace. Also, marijuana is still illegal under federal law. You can buy home tests for many illegal and prescription drugs. There are two types of tests: At-home tests let you do the entire test at home and get rapid results. But if the test result is positive for drugs, you'll need to have a follow-up lab test to check the accuracy of the result. Some at-home tests include a kit for collecting a sample, often urine or saliva, to send to a lab in case the home test is positive. A self-collection test has a kit for gathering urine, saliva, or another type of sample to send to a lab for testing. Some self-collection tests include the cost of a second lab test to check the accuracy of a first test that has positive results. When using home tests, be careful to follow all the instructions. It's best to talk with your provider about using home drug testing so you can decide if it's right for your situation.1References FDA: US Food and Drug Administration [Internet].

Drug use screening tests are questionnaires designed to find out if you are abusing drugs. Drug abuse is a pattern of using drugs that can cause serious problems in your work, relationships, and health. Drug abuse can include taking illegal drugs or misusing legal drugs. Misuse means using the drugs for a nonmedical reason, such as getting high, or taking more than the prescribed dose. It can also mean taking someone else's medicine or taking medicine in a different way than you are supposed to, such as crushing and snorting tablets. Drug abuse is a disease that can make you physically and mentally dependent on drugs. A drug use screening test can help your provider make an effective treatment plan for you. Commonly abused drugs include: Marijuana Prescription opioid pain relievers, which include oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, and codeine Heroin, an illegal opioid Cocaine Methamphetamines Hallucinogens, which are drugs that cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing, and/or feeling things that are not real). They include LSD and Ecstasy (MDMA). Drug abuse may also be called drug addiction or substance abuse. Substance abuse can also refer to the abuse of other substances including alcohol and inhalants. Inhalants are household products, such as paint thinner and certain types of glue, that contain substances that affect perception and mood when inhaled. Other names: Drug Abuse Screen Test (DAST); DAST-10; substance abuse screening; Screening, Brief intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); Cut down Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE) tool; Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) Screening Tool1What are they used for? Drug use screening tests are used to diagnose drug abuse. Some tests can also show if you are at low, moderate, or high risk for complications from drug abuse.1Why do I need a drug use screening test? You may need a screening test if you have symptoms of drug abuse. These include: An urgent need to take the drug on a daily or regular basis Hiding your drug use from others Making excuses to take the drug Continuing to take the drug even if it causes problems in your personal relationships, work, school, and/or health Building up a tolerance to the drug. That means you need more and more of the drug to feel its effects. Many people who abuse drugs don't know or want to admit they have a problem. If your family, friends, or co-workers express concerns about your drug use, talk to your health care provider about getting a screening. Your provider may also recommend a screening if they notice signs and symptoms of the disorder.1What happens during a drug use screening test? Drug use screening may be done by your primary care provider or a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. Some mental health providers specialize in treating drug abuse and similar disorders. Most of these questionnaires are also available online for self-testing. There are different types of drug use screening tests. But they each include questions about your drug use and how it affects your life. The most commonly used drug abuse screening tests are: Drug Abuse Screen Test (DAST, also known as DAST-10). This test contains 10 yes or no questions about how much and how often you take drugs. It also asks if the drugs are causing problems in your life and health. The answers are scored on a point system. A score of 8 or more may indicate a drug problem. NIDA Drug Use Screening Tool, also known as the NIDA Quick Screen. This test, from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), contains questions about how often you use prescription drugs, illegal drugs, tobacco, and alcohol. There is one multiple choice question for each substance. The answers range from "never" to "daily." If you use any of the substances more often than never, it may mean you have a substance abuse problem. NIDA Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening (NM ASSIST). It asks more in-depth questions about the frequency and type of drugs used. It is scored on a point system. The higher your score, the more at risk you are. Cut-down Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE). This contains the following yes or no questions:


Have you ever felt the need to cut-down on your drug use?
Do you ever feel annoyed when people criticize your drug use?
Have you ever felt embarrassed or guilty about your drug use?
Eye-opener: Have you ever used drugs first thing in the morning?

Two or more "yes" answers may indicate a drug problem.
 Have you ever felt the need to cut-down on your drug use? Do you ever feel annoyed when people criticize your drug use? Have you ever felt embarrassed or guilty about your drug use? Eye-opener: Have you ever used drugs first thing in the morning? Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT). This test is designed for teens and includes the following yes or no questions about drug and alcohol use:


Have you ever ridden in a car driven by someone (including yourself) who was high or had been using alcohol or drugs?
Do you ever use alcohol or drugs to relax, feel better about yourself, or fit in?
Do you ever use alcohol/drugs while you are alone?
Do you ever forget things you did while using alcohol or drugs?
Do your family or friends ever tell you that you should cut down on your drinking or drug use?
Have you gotten into trouble while you were using alcohol or drugs?

Two or more "yes" answers to these questions may indicate a drug problem.
 Have you ever ridden in a car driven by someone (including yourself) who was high or had been using alcohol or drugs? Do you ever use alcohol or drugs to relax, feel better about yourself, or fit in? Do you ever use alcohol/drugs while you are alone? Do you ever forget things you did while using alcohol or drugs? Do your family or friends ever tell you that you should cut down on your drinking or drug use? Have you gotten into trouble while you were using alcohol or drugs? These questionnaires may be used along with an approach called Screening, Brief intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT). SBIRT is targeted to developing short-term counseling and educational strategies to change unhealthy drug use. If your test shows you have or are at risk for a serious drug problem, a long-term treatment plan may be recommended.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a drug use screening test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk in taking a questionnaire.1What do the results mean? Results may show whether you are abusing drugs and the severity of the problem. The results can help your provider develop a treatment plan that is right for you.1Is there anything else I need to know about drug use screening tests? Treatment for drug abuse depends on the type of drug and the severity of abuse. Treatment options include: Brief or long-term counseling from a mental health provider who specializes in treating drug abuse Support groups. There are different approaches and formats to drug abuse support groups. Talk with your provider to find a group and approach that's right for you.Medication-assisted treatment. Medication-assisted treatment.  Certain medications can help establish normal brain function and decrease cravings. This may help prevent a relapse. Medications can also make it safer to handle the unpleasant and sometimes dangerous symptoms of withdrawal (symptoms that can happen when you cut back or stop taking drugs). Residential treatment programs. If you have a more serious drug problem, you may be helped by a stay in a facility that specializes in treating drug abuse. These facilities offer a range of treatment services. Stays can last anywhere from one month to a year, depending on your condition. More severe cases of drug abuse, such as a drug overdose, may require emergency treatment in a hospital.1References Addiction Hope [Internet]. Addiction Hope; c2021.

Dysphagia is a term that means difficulty swallowing. Normally when you swallow, food moves easily from your mouth, down your throat, and into your stomach. The food travels through a long tube called the esophagus. If you have dysphagia, it can take more time and effort to move food from your mouth to your stomach. It can be painful and may even prevent you from swallowing at all. Dysphagia can happen at any age but is more common in older adults and people who have certain neurologic diseases. There are many conditions that can cause dysphagia. Some are very serious. Dysphagia tests can help screen for or diagnose these conditions. Other names: bedside swallow, clinical swallow,  dysphagia screening tool, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallow (FEES), barium swallow, esophagram, videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), upper endoscopy1What are they used for? Dysphagia tests are used to find out why you have trouble swallowing.1Why do I need a dysphagia test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of dysphagia. These include: Coughing or gagging when swallowing Feeling of food being stuck in your throat Pain when swallowing Being unable to swallow Food or liquids coming back up through your throat or mouth, including from GERD (gastroesphogeal reflux disease) Frequent heartburn A hoarse or weaker voice Weight loss1What happens during a dysphagia test? There are several different types of dysphagia tests. Depending on your symptoms, you may have one or more of the following tests: Bedside Swallow Screen You will sit upright in a bed or chair. A provider may ask you questions about your symptoms and how long you've had trouble swallowing. You may be asked to do certain movements such as smacking your lips together or sticking out your jaw. You will be given different foods and drinks to swallow. These may include water, other liquids, soft foods, and solid foods. The provider will check your teeth, lips, jaw, cheeks, and neck while you swallow. A bedside swallow test is a common type of dysphagia screening tool. Other tools include a questionnaire and a water swallow test. Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallow (FEES) You will sit upright in a bed or chair. A provider will slide an endoscope (a tube with a light and camera) into your nose and to the back of your throat. You will eat bits of food and/or drink liquids. The endoscope allows your provider to watch food travel down your throat as you swallow. Upper Endoscopy You will lie on your side on an exam table. An IV (intravenous) line will be placed in your arm or hand. Medicine to relax you will be injected into the IV. Your provider may spray a numbing medicine on the back of your throat. Once the relaxing and numbing medicines have taken effect, your provider will insert an endoscope into your mouth and throat. The endoscope will take pictures of your esophagus, stomach, and part of your small intestine. Your provider may take a biopsy (removal of a small sample of tissue) to examine after the procedure. Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS), also known as a Modified Barium Swallow You will stand or sit on an x-ray table. You will be given different foods and liquids that are covered with barium. Barium is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray While you swallow, a special x-ray called fluoroscopy will track the barium-coated food in real time as it moves through your mouth, throat, and esophagus.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. You may also want to make a list of your swallowing problems ahead of time. Then you can share them with your provider at the time of your test. If you are having an upper endoscopy, you will be given a medicine that can make you drowsy, so you should arrange for someone to drive you home.1Are there any risks to the tests? There is very little risk to having a bedside swallow, but there is a small chance that fluid might get into your lungs during the procedure. During a FEES or upper endoscopy, you may feel some discomfort when the endoscope is inserted, but serious complications are rare. During an upper endoscopy, there is a very small risk of getting a tear in your intestine. If you had a biopsy, there is a small risk of bleeding at the site. Bleeding usually stops without treatment. You should not have a VFSS, which is a type of x-ray, if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. The radiation from these x-rays can be harmful to an unborn baby. For others, there is little risk to having these tests. The dose of radiation is very low and not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.1What do the results mean? Your results may show you have one of the following types of disorders: Oral cavity dysphagia, a disorder of the mouth. Conditions include: Weakness after a stroke Muscular or nerve problem Oropharyngeal dysphagia, a disorder of the throat. Conditions include: Certain types of cancer Neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, a small pouch that forms and collects food particles in your throat Esophageal dysphagia, a disorder of the esophagus. Conditions include: Esophageal stricture (narrowing of the esophagus) Tumor of the esophagus GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), a condition in which contents of the stomach leak backward into the esophagus A bedside swallow screen or other type of dysphagia screening tool will only show if you are at risk for one of the above disorders. If your results show you are at risk, your provider will probably order follow-up testing. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about dysphagia tests? If you are having trouble swallowing, your health care provider may refer you to one of the following specialists: Speech and language pathologist, a health care provider that specializes in diagnosing and treating speech, language, and communication disorders An otolaryngologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the ear, nose, and throat Gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the digestive system Neurologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system1References American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) [Internet].

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/dysphagia-difficulty-swallowing-4171577 Elastography : 1What is elastography? Elastography is a type of imaging test that checks your organs to see if they are stiffer than normal. Stiff areas in your organs may be a sign of disease. Elastography is mainly used to check the liver for stiffness. Stiff areas in the liver are a sign of scar tissue (fibrosis) caused by liver disease. Liver fibrosis happens when certain diseases damage the liver over time. When the liver tries to heal, it forms more scar tissue. Many conditions that cause ongoing or repeated liver damage can lead to liver fibrosis. Conditions that commonly cause fibrosis include: Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B. These liver diseases are caused by viruses. Alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD can cause alcohol-associated liver disease, which includes the buildup of too much fat in the liver. The fat can cause liver inflammation (swelling) which damages liver tissue. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This type of fat buildup often happens in people who have diabetes, obesity, and/or high levels of cholesterol in their blood. It is not from drinking too much alcohol. As fibrosis develops, scar tissue replaces healthy liver cells and prevents your liver from working normally. The scar tissue can reduce blood flow in your liver. The lack of blood causes more liver damage and more fibrosis. Without treatment, fibrosis can become severe. Severe fibrosis is called cirrhosis. With cirrhosis, liver scarring is permanent. It can cause serious health problems, including liver failure. Cirrhosis also increases your chance of getting liver cancer. Fibrosis and early cirrhosis don't always cause symptoms. But elastography can help find liver scarring early, so treatment can start before the damage becomes severe. There are two types of liver elastography tests: Ultrasound elastography is also called transient elastography. An ultrasound device uses sound waves to send vibrations into your liver. The device measures how fast the vibrations move through your liver. If you have areas of stiff liver tissue, the vibrations will move faster through that area. A computer uses the measurements to make an image that shows any stiffness in your liver tissue, which is a sign of fibrosis. MRE (magnetic resonance elastography) sends vibrations into your liver that are measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a procedure that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create images of organs and structures inside the body. In an MRE test, a computer program makes a map that shows any stiff areas of your liver. Other names: liver elastography, transient elastography, FibroScan, MR elastography1What is it used for? Liver elastography is used to check for liver fibrosis (scarring).  It may be used instead of a liver biopsy, which involves removing a piece of liver tissue for testing. The information from an elastography test can help: Diagnose liver conditions in people who have a high risk for liver disease Show how serious liver disease is Guide treatment choices for liver disease Monitor how well treatment for liver disease is working Help predict the chance that liver disease will cause certain serious problems Check how much fat is in the liver1Why do I need an elastography test? You may need an elastography test to check for liver fibrosis (scarring) if you: Have liver disease and your health care provider needs information to guide treatment choices. Have had other liver tests that show you may have inflammation or damage in your liver. Are more likely to develop cirrhosis (severe liver scarring). Conditions that increase your risk for cirrhosis include:

Alcohol use disorder (AUD)
Type 2 diabetes
Chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B or C
Certain autoimmune diseases or genetic disorders
Long-term use of certain medicines

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) Type 2 diabetes Chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B or C Certain autoimmune diseases or genetic disorders Long-term use of certain medicines Have signs or symptoms of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis may not cause symptoms until your liver is badly damaged. Symptoms of early cirrhosis may include: Feeling tired or weak Having a poor appetite Losing weight without trying Nausea and vomiting Mild pain in the upper ride side of your abdomen (belly) As your liver condition gets worse, you may have other symptoms, including: Bruising and bleeding easily Confusion, memory loss, or sleep disorders Swelling in your legs or feet Bloating or full feeling in your abdomen from fluid buildup Itchy skin Dark urine (pee) Jaundice (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow)1What happens during an elastography test? An ultrasound elastography is often done by a radiology technician, who is a health care professional trained to do imaging tests. Sometimes a radiologist does the test. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using medical imaging tests to diagnose medical conditions. An elastography test is quick and usually includes these steps: You'll remove clothing covering your right abdomen (belly) to expose the skin over your liver. You'll lie on a table and the technician will spread a special gel on your skin. The technician will hold a wand-like device, called a transducer, and move it across your skin. You'll hold your breath for 10 to 15 seconds while the device sends a series of vibrations into your liver. You may feel the device pulse against your skin, but it doesn't hurt. The vibrations will travel through your liver and "bounce" back to the device which sends the information to a computer. The computer makes an image of your liver showing any areas of stiff tissue and other signs of liver disease. MRE (magnetic resonance elastography) is done with an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine. During an MRE procedure: You'll lie on a narrow exam table. The technician will place some small devices on your lower right abdomen. One device, called a "driver," will send painless vibrations into your liver. The other devices send and receive radio waves to a computer. The table will slide into a large tunnel-like MRI machine. You will hear loud noises as the machine takes pictures. You may be given earplugs or headphones to block the noise. Inside the MRI, you'll be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 15 seconds when the vibrations are going through your liver. The computer will make images of your liver that show any scarring and/or other signs of liver disease.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your provider will tell you how to prepare for a liver elastography. In general, it's best to wear a loose-fitting shirt or sweater that you can easily pull up. You may be told to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. If you're having an MRE, you'll need to remove all metal from your body. If you have any medical devices or metal inside your body let your provider know. The scanner can heat metal and cause burns.1Are there any risks to the test?  There are no known risks to having an ultrasound elastography. There is little risk to having an MRE for most people. If being inside a small space makes you nervous, tell your provider before your test. Your provider may give you medicine to help you relax. If you are or could be pregnant, let your provider know.1What do the results mean? Your elastography images will be studied by a radiologist, who will send your results to your provider. Your results will show how much stiffness was found in your liver. This tells you how much liver scarring (fibrosis) you have. Your results will be given a fibrosis score which is based on the amount of stiffness in your liver and the cause: F0 to F1 is normal, which means you have little or no scarring in your liver. F2 means you have moderate scarring. F3 means you have severe scarring. F4 means you have cirrhosis (very severe scarring). Your results also show how much fat buildup you have in your liver. The measurement of fat in your liver is called a "CAP score." It tells you the percentage of your liver that is fat. The amount of fat in a normal liver is 5% or less. Higher amounts mean you have fatty liver disease, which may cause fibrosis. If you have mild to severe fibrosis and/or fatty liver disease, your condition can improve if you treat the cause and make lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. If you have cirrhosis, treating the cause may keep liver scarring from getting worse. Successful treatment may slowly improve some of the scarring. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an elastography? Certain conditions can affect the accuracy of an elastography test. These include: Liver inflammation (swelling) from an illness or drinking alcohol Tumors in your liver Obesity Abnormal fluid buildup your abdomen (belly)1References American Liver Foundation.

An electrocardiogram (EKG) test is a simple, painless, and quick test that records your heart's electrical activity. Each time your heart beats, an electrical signal travels through your heart. The signal triggers your heart's four chambers to contract (squeeze) in the proper rhythm so that your heart can pump blood to your body. An EKG recording of these signals looks like wavy lines. Your provider can read these lines to look for abnormal heart activity that may be a sign of heart disease or damage. An EKG can show: How fast your heart is beating Whether the rhythm of your heartbeat is steady or irregular The strength and timing of the electrical signals passing through each part of your heart Sometimes information from an EKG can help measure the size and position of your heart's chambers. An EKG is often the first test you'll have if you have signs of a heart condition. It may be done in your provider's office, an outpatient clinic, in a hospital before surgery, or as part of another heart test called a stress test. An EKG test is also called an ECG. EKG is based on the German spelling, elektrokardiogramm. EKG may be preferred over ECG to avoid confusion with an EEG, a test that measures brain waves. Other names:  ECG test, Holter monitor, ambulatory electrocardiography, continuous electrocardiograms, transtelephonic event monitors1What is it used for? An EKG test is used to help diagnose and monitor many types of heart conditions and their treatment. These conditions include: Arrhythmia Cardiomyopathy Coronary artery disease Heart attack Heart failure Heart valve diseases Congenital heart defects EKG tests are mainly used for people who have symptoms of a heart condition or have already been diagnosed with a heart condition. They are not generally used to screen people who don't have symptoms unless they have an increased risk of developing heart disease. Your provider can explain your risk for heart disease and let you know if need to have an EKG test. In certain cases, your provider may have you see a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases.1Why do I need an EKG test? You may need an EKG test if you have symptoms of a heart condition, including: Chest pain Rapid or irregular heartbeat Shortness of breath Dizziness Fatigue A decrease in your ability to exercise You may also need an EKG to: Find out if you had a heart attack in the past but didn't know it Monitor your heart if you have a known heart condition Check how well your heart treatment is working, including medicine and/or a pacemaker Check your heart health:

Before having surgery
If you have an increased risk for developing heart disease because:

Heart disease runs in your family
You have another condition, such as diabetes, that makes your risk higher than normal



 Before having surgery If you have an increased risk for developing heart disease because:

Heart disease runs in your family
You have another condition, such as diabetes, that makes your risk higher than normal

 Heart disease runs in your family You have another condition, such as diabetes, that makes your risk higher than normal1What happens during an EKG test? An EKG test only takes a few minutes. It generally includes these steps: You will lie on an exam table. A provider will place several electrodes (small sensors that stick to your skin) on your arms, legs, and chest. The provider may need to shave body hair to make sure the electrodes stay on. The electrodes are attached by wires to a computer or a special EKG machine You will lie very still while your heart's electrical activity is recorded on a computer or printed on paper by an EKG machine.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an EKG test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having an EKG. You may feel a little discomfort or skin irritation after the electrodes are removed. The EKG doesn't send any electricity to your body. It only records electrical signals from your heart, so there's no risk of electric shock.1What do the results mean? Your provider will check your EKG results for a steady heartbeat and rhythm. If your results are not normal, it may be a sign of a heart condition. The specific condition depends on which part of your EKG wasn't normal. You may need to have other heart health tests before your provider can make a diagnosis. Your provider can explain what your test results mean for your heart health and treatment. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an EKG? An EKG is a "snapshot" of your heart's activity over a very short time. If you have heart symptoms that come and go, a regular EKG may not catch the problem. In that case, your provider may recommend that you wear a small portable EKG monitor that can record your heart for days or longer while you do your normal activities. You may also need a longer EKG recording if your provider wants to check how well your heart is working after a heart attack or to see if treatment is helping you. There are many types of long-term EKG monitors. The two main groups are Holter monitors, which can be worn for up to two days, and event monitors, which may record your heart activity for weeks to years depending on the type. A Holter monitor is about the size of a small camera. You usually wear it on a belt or strap around your neck for a day or two. Wires under your clothes attach to electrodes that stick to your chest. The monitor records your heart's electrical signals the whole time you're wearing it. You may be asked to keep a diary of your symptoms during the test period. After the test period, you remove the monitor and return it according to the instructions. A provider will review the recording of your heart's electrical activity from the monitor. An event monitor records your heart's electrical activity when you press a button or when the device detects abnormal heart activity.  There two main types of event monitors: Event monitors that you wear or carry with you. You wear some monitors on your chest or wrist. Other monitors are designed to carry. If you have symptoms, you hold the monitor to your chest. These event monitors may be used for weeks to months. Some of them wirelessly transmit information about your heart to a provider. Others must be returned so a provider can examine the recorded information. Event monitors that are inserted under the skin of your chest. These are called implantable event monitors. They are put under your skin during minor surgery that's often done in a doctor's office. These monitors can track your heart's electrical activity for years.  You may need this type of EKG monitor if you had a stroke or frequent fainting, and your provider hasn't found the cause. Implantable monitors wirelessly transmit the information they record so your provider can regularly check it.1References AAFP [Internet]. Leawood (KS): American Academy of Family Physicians; c2022.

Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body. They also help control muscle and nerve activity, heart rhythm, and other important functions. An electrolyte panel, also known as a serum electrolyte test, is a blood test that measures levels of the body's main electrolytes: Sodium, which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure. Potassium, which helps your heart and muscles work properly. Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance. It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream. Abnormal levels of any of these electrolytes can be a sign of a serious health problem, including kidney disease, high blood pressure, and a life-threatening irregularity in heart rhythm. Other names: serum electrolyte test, lytes, sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), carbon dioxide (CO2)1What is it used for? An electrolyte panel is often part of a routine blood screening or a comprehensive metabolic panel. The test may also be used to find out if your body has a fluid imbalance or an imbalance in acid and base levels. Electrolytes are usually measured together. But sometimes they are tested individually. Separate testing may be done if a provider suspects a problem with a specific electrolyte.1Why do I need an electrolyte panel? You may need this test if you have symptoms indicating that your body's electrolytes may be out of balance. These include: Nausea and/or vomiting Confusion Weakness Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)1What happens during an electrolyte panel? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for an electrolyte panel.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will include measurements for each electrolyte. Abnormal electrolyte levels can be caused by several different conditions, including: Dehydration Kidney disease Heart disease Diabetes Acidosis, a condition in which you have too much acid in your blood. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Alkalosis, a condition in which you have too much base in your blood. It can cause irritability, muscle twitching, and tingling in the fingers and toes. Your specific results will depend on which electrolyte is affected and whether levels are too low or too high. If your electrolyte levels were not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical problem needing treatment. Many factors can affect electrolyte levels. These include taking in too much fluid or losing fluid because of vomiting or diarrhea. Also, certain medicines such as antacids and blood pressure medicines may cause abnormal results. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an electrolyte panel? Your health care provider may order another test, called an anion gap, along with your electrolyte panel. Some electrolytes have a positive electric charge. Others have a negative electric charge. The anion gap is a measurement of the difference between the negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes. If the anion gap is either too high or too low, it may be a sign of a serious health problem.1References Health Testing Centers [Internet]. Fort Lauderdale (FL): Health Testing Centers.com; c2019.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw203476 Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies : 1What are electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies? Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies are tests that measure the electrical activity of muscles and nerves. Nerves send out electrical signals to make your muscles react in certain ways. As your muscles react, they give off these signals, which can then be measured. An EMG test looks at the electrical signals your muscles make when they are at rest and when they are being used. A nerve conduction study measures how fast and how well the body's electrical signals travel down your nerves. EMG tests and nerve conduction studies can both help find out if you have a disorder of your muscles, nerves, or both. These tests can be done separately, but they are usually done at the same time. Other names: electrodiagnostic study, EMG test, electromyogram, NCS, nerve conduction velocity, NCV1What are they used for? EMG and nerve conduction studies are used to help diagnose a variety of muscle and nerve disorders. An EMG test helps find out if muscles are responding the right way to nerve signals. Nerve conduction studies help diagnose nerve damage or disease. When EMG tests and nerve conduction studies are done together, it helps providers tell if your symptoms are caused by a muscle disorder or a nerve problem.1Why do I need an EMG test and a nerve conduction study? You may need these tests if you have symptoms of a muscle or nerve disorder. These symptoms include: Muscle weakness Tingling or numbness in arms, legs, hands, feet, and/or face Muscle cramps, spasms, and/or twitching Paralysis of any muscles1What happens during an EMG test and nerve conduction study? For an EMG test: You will sit or lie down on a table or bed. Your provider will clean the skin over the muscle being tested. Your provider will place a needle electrode into the muscle. A needle electrode is a special wire that a mild electric current flows through. You may have slight pain or discomfort when the electrode is inserted. The machine will record the muscle activity while your muscle is at rest. Then you will be asked to tighten (contract) the muscle slowly and steadily. The machine will record this activity. The electrode may be moved to record activity in different muscles. The electrical activity is recorded and shown on a video screen. The activity is displayed as wavy and spiky lines. The activity may also be recorded and sent to an audio speaker. You may hear popping sounds when you contract your muscle. For a nerve conduction study: You will sit or lie down on a table or bed. Your provider will attach one or more electrodes to a certain nerve or nerves using tape or a paste. The electrodes, called stimulating electrodes, deliver a mild electrical pulse. Your provider will attach different types of electrodes to the muscle or muscles controlled by those nerves. These electrodes will record the responses to the electrical stimulation from the nerve. Your provider will send a small pulse of electricity through the stimulating electrodes to stimulate the nerve to send a signal to the muscle. This may cause a mild tingling feeling. Your provider will record the time it takes for your muscle to respond to the nerve signal. The speed of the response is called the conduction velocity. If you are having both tests, the nerve conduction study will be done first.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests? Tell your health care provider if you have a pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator. Special steps will need to be taken before the test if you have one of these devices. Wear loose, comfortable clothing that allows easy access to the test area or can be easily removed if you need to change into a hospital gown. Make sure your skin is clean. Don't use lotions, creams, or perfumes for a day or two before the test.1Are there any risks to the tests? You may feel a little pain or cramping during an EMG test. You may have a tingly feeling, like a mild electric shock, during a nerve conduction study.1What do the results mean? If your results were not normal, it can indicate a variety of different conditions. Depending on which muscles or nerves are affected, it may mean one of the following: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition that affects nerves in the hand and arm. It's usually not serious, but can be painful. Herniated disc, a condition that happens when a part of your spine, called a disc, is damaged. This puts pressure on the spine, causing pain and numbness Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves. It can lead to numbness, tingling, and paralysis. Most people recover from the disorder after treatment Myasthenia gravis, a rare disorder that causes muscle fatigue and weakness. Muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease that seriously affects muscle structure and function. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited disorder that causes nerve damage, mostly in the arms and legs. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. This is a progressive, ultimately fatal, disorder that attacks nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. It affects all the muscles you use to move, speak, eat, and breathe. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.11References Cleveland Clinic [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c2019.

Epithelial cells are a type of cell that covers the inside and outside of the surfaces of your body. They are found on your skin, blood vessels, and organs, including your urinary tract. An epithelial cells in urine test looks at a sample of your urine (pee) under a microscope to count the number of epithelial cells in your urine. It's normal to have a small number of certain types of epithelial cells in urine. A large number may indicate a urinary tract infection, kidney disease, or other serious medical condition. Other names: microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine, urine test, urine analysis, UA1What is it used for? An epithelial cells in urine test is a part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different substances in your urine. It may be part of a regular check-up, or your health care provider may order the test if you have signs of a urinary tract problem. A urinalysis may include a visual check of your urine sample, tests for certain chemicals and examination under a microscope to look for certain types of cells. An epithelial cells in urine test is part of a microscopic exam of urine.1Why do I need an epithelial cells in urine test? Your provider may have ordered an epithelial cells in urine test as part of your regular checkup or if the results of your visual or chemical urine tests weren't normal. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of a urinary or kidney disorder. These symptoms may include: Frequent and/or painful urination Abdominal pain Back pain1What happens during an epithelial cells in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample of your urine for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for the test. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having the test1What do the results mean? Results are often reported as a general amount, such as "few," moderate," or "many" cells. A normal result is typically "few" cells. "Moderate" or "many" cells may be a sign of a medical condition, such as: Urinary tract infection Yeast infection Kidney disease Liver disease Certain types of cancer If your results are not normal, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. You may need more tests before your provider can make a diagnosis. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an epithelial cells in urine test? There are three types of epithelial cells that line the urinary tract. They are called transitional cells, renal (kidney) tubular cells, and squamous cells. If there are squamous epithelial cells in your urine, it may mean your sample was contaminated. This means that the sample contains cells from another part of the body. This can happen if you do not clean your genital area well enough when collecting your urine sample with the clean catch method.1References Ask a Biologist [Internet].

An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that that can show if you have inflammation in your body. Inflammation is your immune system's response to injury, infection, and many types of conditions, including immune system disorders, certain cancers, and blood disorders. Erythrocytes are red blood cells. To do an ESR test, a sample of your blood is sent to a lab. A health care professional places the sample in a tall, thin test tube and measures how quickly the red blood cells settle or sink to the bottom of the tube. Normally, red blood cells sink slowly. But inflammation makes red blood cells stick together in clumps. These clumps of cells are heavier than single cells, so they sink faster. If an ESR test shows that your red blood cells sink faster than normal, it may mean you have a medical condition causing inflammation. The speed of your test result is a sign of how much inflammation you have. Faster ESR rates mean higher levels of inflammation. But an ESR test alone cannot diagnose what condition is causing the inflammation. Other names: ESR, SED rate sedimentation rate; Westergren sedimentation rate1What is it used for? An ESR test can be used with other tests to help diagnose conditions that cause inflammation. It can also be used to help monitor these conditions. Many types of conditions cause inflammation, including arthritis, vasculitis, infection, and inflammatory bowel disease. An ESR may also be used to monitor an existing condition.1Why do I need an ESR? Your health care provider may order an ESR if you have symptoms of a condition that causes inflammation. Your symptoms will depend on the condition you may have, but they may include: Headaches Unexplained fever Weight loss Joint stiffness Neck or shoulder pain Loss of appetite Anemia1What happens during an ESR? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for an ESR? You don't need any special preparations for this test. But if your provider ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having an ESR. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider will use the results of your ESR test along with your medical history, symptoms, and other test results to make a diagnosis. An ESR test alone cannot diagnose conditions that cause inflammation. A high ESR test result may be from a condition that causes inflammation, such as: Arteritis Arthritis Systemic vasculitis Polymyalgia rheumatica Inflammatory bowel disease Kidney disease Infection Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases Heart disease Certain cancers A low ESR test result means your red blood cells sank more slowly than normal. This may be caused by conditions such as: A blood disorder, such as:

Polycythemia
Sickle cell disease (SCD)
Leukocytosis, a very high white blood cell count (WBC)

 Polycythemia Sickle cell disease (SCD) Leukocytosis, a very high white blood cell count (WBC) Heart failure Certain kidney and liver problems If your ESR results are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Pregnancy, a menstrual cycle, aging, obesity, drinking alcohol regularly, and exercise can affect ESR results.  Certain medicines and supplements may also affect your results, so be sure to tell your provider about any medicines or supplements you are taking. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an ESR? Because an ESR can't diagnose a specific disease, your provider may order other tests at the same time. Also, it's possible to have a condition that causes inflammation and still have a normal ESR result. A C-reactive protein (CRP) test is commonly done with an ESR to provide more information.1References Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing [Internet].

An esophageal pH test measures how often stomach acid enters the esophagus, the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. It also measures how long the acid stays there. The test involves placing a catheter (a thin tube), or a special device called a pH probe, into your esophagus. The catheter or device will measure your acid level (known as pH level) for 24 to 96 hours. The test can show if you have acid reflux or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Acid reflux is a disorder that happens when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. When the acid touches the esophagus, it can cause a burning feeling in your chest or neck. This is known as heartburn. Acid reflux can lead to GERD, a more serious form of reflux. While acid reflux and GERD are not life-threatening, the symptoms can be very uncomfortable and affect your quality of life. Also, if not treated, GERD can damage the esophagus and lead to more serious health problems. Other names: esophageal pH monitoring 24-hour esophageal pH test, esophageal reflux monitoring, esophageal acidity test, pH monitoring, pH probe study1What is it used for? An esophageal pH test is most often used to diagnose acid reflux or GERD. It may also be used to see if treatment for GERD is effective.1Why do I need an esophageal pH test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of acid reflux. These include: Heartburn Swallowed food coming back into your mouth (regurgitation) Trouble swallowing Feeling a lump in your throat Sore throat Cough Frequent burping1What happens during an esophageal pH test? An esophageal pH test may be done using a thin tube called a catheter or with a wireless pH probe (a small, capsule-like device). During a catheter test: Your health care provider will insert a small, thin tube through your mouth or nose. One end of the tube will extend down to your esophagus. The tube has a sensor that measures your acid level. The other end of the tube will be connected to a small monitor that you wear around your waist or over your shoulder. The monitor will measure your acid levels for 24 hours. You will keep a diary of your symptoms and the food you eat during these 24 hours. The next day, you will see your provider, who will remove the tube and monitor. You'll also give your provider the diary of your symptoms and food eaten. During a wireless test, also known as a pH probe study: Your provider will attach a pH probe to the lining of your esophagus during an upper endoscopy, a procedure that is done using an endoscope. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and camera. You will get a medicine to block the pain and make you feel relaxed and sleepy during the procedure. The probe will measure acid levels for 48 to 96 hours. The probe will send the information to a device you wear on your wrist or belt. You will need to keep a diary of your symptoms and food you eat for 48 to 96 hours. In 4 to 10 days, the probe will leave your body through a bowel movement. After the probe stops transmitting (after 48-96 hours), you will give the diary to your provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will need to not eat or drink for four to six hours before the procedure. You may be asked to stop taking certain medicines, such as antacids, for 24 hours or for as long as two weeks before your test. Your provider will let you know which medicines to avoid and for how long.1Are there any risks to the test? During a catheter test, you may feel some mild discomfort in your nose and throat, but it usually doesn't last long. You may also feel like gagging when the tube is inserted. Rarely, the test can cause a nosebleed. During a wireless test, you may have a sore throat from the endoscope. In very rare cases, the test may cause a tear in the lining of the esophagus.1What do the results mean? If your results show high acid levels, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Acid reflux GERD Esophagitis, a condition that cause swelling and/or inflammation of the esophagus. It can cause difficulty swallowing. Stricture, a narrowing of the esophagus that can make it hard to swallow and cause breathing problems Barrett's esophagus, a condition that affects the lining of the esophagus. It can raise the risk of developing cancer of the esophagus. Esophagitis, strictures, and Barrett's esophagus can happen if GERD is left untreated or if treatment is not effective. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about an esophageal pH test? If you've been diagnosed with acid reflux or GERD, you may be able to reduce or eliminate your symptoms with diet and lifestyle changes. Diet changes include limiting: Fatty foods Spicy foods Citrus fruits and juices Tomatoes and tomato products Alcohol Lifestyle changes include: Eating smaller amounts Quitting smoking Waiting a few hours after eating before you lie down Losing weight if needed Over-the-counter medicines, such as antacids, may also be helpful. If your symptoms don't improve or are more serious, your provider may recommend treatments to reduce or block acid production. These may include over-the-counter and/or prescription medications. Sometimes surgery is recommended for people with more severe and/or persistent symptoms.1References American Gastroenterological Association [Internet].

An estrogen test measures the level of estrogens usually in a sample of your blood, but sometimes in urine (pee). Estrogens are a group of hormones that play a key role in female reproductive health, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. Estrogens are also important for heart, bone, and brain health in males and females. But males need estrogen in much smaller amounts. There are many types of estrogen, but only three types are commonly tested: Estrone, also called E1, is the only estrogen that females continue to make after menopause. Menopause is the time after menstrual periods have stopped for a year.  Males and females make estrone in the adrenal glands (glands that sit on top of each kidney), and in body fat. In females, the ovaries (the glands that contain eggs) also make estrone. Estradiol, also called E2, is the main estrogen in nonpregnant females of childbearing age. It's mostly made in the ovaries and is important for fertility (the ability to get pregnant). It also helps support brain and bone health. Males make small amounts of this estrogen in the testicles (the glands that make sperm). Estriol, also called E3, is an estrogen that increases during pregnancy. The placenta (the organ that grows in the uterus to provide nutrients and oxygen to the unborn baby) makes estriol. Measuring estriol levels can help monitor the health of a pregnancy and the unborn baby. Males and nonpregnant females have very low levels of this estrogen. Estrogen levels in females normally change a lot throughout life. In males, estrogen levels change much less. But levels that stay too high or too low may be a sign of a health problem. Other names: estradiol test, estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), estrogenic hormone test1What is it used for? In females, estradiol and/or estrone testing may be used: To help diagnose conditions that may be caused by estrogen levels that are too high or too low, such as:


Early or late puberty
Menstrual problems or abnormal vaginal bleeding
Infertility (problems getting pregnant)

 Early or late puberty Menstrual problems or abnormal vaginal bleeding Infertility (problems getting pregnant) To help monitor:

Infertility treatments
Hormone replacement therapy for menopause
Hormone treatment for certain cancers, such as breast cancer

 Infertility treatments Hormone replacement therapy for menopause Hormone treatment for certain cancers, such as breast cancer During pregnancy, an estriol hormone test may be used to:


Help diagnose certain birth defects
Monitor a high-risk pregnancy

 Help diagnose certain birth defects Monitor a high-risk pregnancy In males, estradiol and/or estrone tests may be used to see whether too much estrogen is causing conditions, such as:


Late puberty
Breast growth (gynecomastia)
Infertility
Erectile dysfunction (ED), problems having an erection

 Late puberty Breast growth (gynecomastia) Infertility Erectile dysfunction (ED), problems having an erection1Why do I need an estrogen test? If you are female, you may need estrogen testing if you: Have early or delayed puberty Are childbearing age and have abnormal periods or no periods at all Are having trouble getting pregnant Have a high-risk pregnancy Have symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and/or night sweats Use hormone replacement therapy after menopause Have vaginal bleeding after menopause Have a tumor that may be making estrogen If you're pregnant, you may have an estriol test between weeks 15 and 20 of your pregnancy. The test may be part of a group of prenatal tests called a triple screen test or a quad screening test. The test can check whether your baby has a high risk for a genetic birth defect such as Down syndrome. You may be more likely to have a baby with a birth defect if you: Have a family history of birth defects Are age 35 or older Have diabetes Have had a viral infection during pregnancy If you are male, you may need estrogen testing if you have: Delayed puberty Enlarged breasts or other symptoms of too much estrogen Have a tumor that may be making estrogen1What happens during an estrogen test? If you are tested at your provider's office or a lab, you will provide a blood or urine sample. If you use an at-home test, the sample is usually saliva (spit). For a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a urine test: You'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual.  Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed. For an at-home saliva test: You'll collect a sample of saliva and send it to a lab for testing. Ask your provider which test is best to use. Be sure to follow all the instructions that come with your kit and discuss your results with your provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an estrogen test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no known risk to a urine or saliva test.1What do the results mean? Your test results will mean different things depending on: Your age Your sex The reasons for having the test The type of estrogen that was measured The results of other tests you may have had Talk with your provider to find out what your results mean for your health. Because estrogen levels often change, you may need to be tested more than once to look for a trend in your estrogen levels over time.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw6200 Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor Tests : 1What are estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests? Estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests are used to help guide breast cancer treatment. Receptors are proteins that attach to certain substances. ER/PR tests look for receptors that attach to the hormones estrogen and progesterone in a sample of breast cancer tissue. Estrogen and progesterone play key roles in a woman's sexual development and reproductive functions. Men also have these hormones, but in much smaller amounts. About 70 percent of all breast cancers in women have receptors that attach to estrogen and/or progesterone. About 80 percent to 90 percent of breast cancers in men have these receptors. Breast cancers with estrogen and/or progesterone receptors include the following types: ER-positive (ER+): Cancers that have estrogen receptors (ER) PR-positive (PR+): Cancers that have progesterone receptors (PR) Hormone receptor-positive (HR+): Cancers that have one or both types of these receptors. Breast cancers without ER or PR receptors are known as HR-negative (HR-). ER/PR tests will show whether there are ER and/or PR receptors on your breast cancer cells. Test results are frequently referred to as the hormone receptor status. If your hormone receptor status shows you have one or both of these receptors on your cancer cells, you may respond well to certain types of treatments. Other names: ER/PR IHC testing, hormone receptor status1What are they used for? ER/PR tests are used to guide treatment for breast cancer patients.1Why do I need an ER/PR test? You may need this test if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer. Knowing your hormone receptor status will help your health care provider decide how to treat it. If you have ER-positive, PR-positive, or HR-positive cancer, drugs that lower hormone levels or stop the hormones from fueling cancer growth can be very effective. If you have HR-negative cancer, these types of drugs won't work for you.1What happens during ER/PR testing? Your provider will need to take a sample of breast tissue in a procedure called a breast biopsy. There are three main types of breast biopsies: Fine needle aspiration biopsy, which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid Core needle biopsy, which uses a larger needle to remove a sample Surgical biopsy, which removes a sample in a minor, outpatient procedure Fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies usually include the following steps: You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table. A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Once the area is numb, the provider will insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of tissue or fluid. You may feel a little pressure when the sample is withdrawn. Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops. Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site. In a surgical biopsy, a surgeon will make a small cut in your skin to remove all or part of a breast lump. A surgical biopsy is sometimes done if the lump can't be reached with a needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include the following steps. You will lie on an operating table. An IV (intravenous line) may be placed in your arm or hand. You may be given medicine, called a sedative, to help you relax. You will be given local or general anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during the procedure.

For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area.
For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine so you will be unconscious during the procedure.

 For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area. For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine so you will be unconscious during the procedure. Once the biopsy area is numb or you are unconscious, the surgeon will make a small cut into the breast and remove part or all of a lump. Some tissue around the lump may also be removed. The cut in your skin will be closed with stitches or adhesive strips.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You won't need any special preparations if you are getting local anesthesia (numbing of the biopsy site). If you are getting general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. Your surgeon will give you more specific instructions. Also, if you are getting a sedative or general anesthesia, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home. You may be groggy and confused after you wake up from the procedure.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. Sometimes the site gets infected. If that happens, you will be treated with antibiotics. A surgical biopsy may cause some additional pain and discomfort. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe medicine to help you feel better.1What do the results mean? The results will show whether you have a hormone receptor-positive or negative type of cancer. If your hormone receptor status is positive, the test also shows the levels of estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The higher the levels of receptors, the more effective certain medicines may be in treating your cancer. If your hormone receptor status is negative, these medicines will not be effective. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about ER/PR tests? HER2 testing is often done at the same time as ER/PR testing. That is because some hormone receptor cancers are also HER2-positive. HER2 is a protein found on the surface of all breast cells. Treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer can be very effective but are not effective for HER2-negative cancers.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/hormone-receptor-status-and-diagnosis-430106 Fall Risk Assessment : 1What is a fall risk assessment? Falls are common in adults 65 years of age and older. In the United States, about a third of older adults who live at home and about half of people living in nursing homes fall at least once a year. There are many factors that increase the risk of falling in older adults. These include mobility problems, balance disorders, chronic illnesses, and impaired vision. Many falls cause at least some injury. These range from mild bruising to broken bones, head injuries, and even death. In fact, falls are a leading cause of death in older adults. A fall risk assessment checks to see how likely it is that you will fall. It is mostly done for older adults. The assessment usually includes: An initial screening. This includes a series of questions about your overall health and if you've had previous falls or problems with balance, standing, and/or walking. A set of tasks, known as fall assessment tools. These tools test your strength, balance, and gait (the way you walk). Other names: fall risk evaluation, fall risk screening, assessment, and intervention1What is it used for? A fall risk assessment is used to find out if you have a low, moderate, or high risk of falling. If the assessment shows you are at an increased risk, your health care provider and/or caregiver may recommend strategies to prevent falls and reduce the chance of injury.1Why do I need a fall risk assessment? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Geriatric Society recommend yearly fall assessment screening for all adults 65 years of age and older. If the screening shows you are at risk, you may need an assessment. The assessment includes performing a series of tasks called fall assessment tools. You also may need an assessment if you have certain symptoms. Falls often come without warning, but if you have any of the following symptoms, you may be at higher risk: Dizziness Light-headedness Irregular or rapid heartbeats1What happens during a fall risk assessment? Many providers use an approach developed by the CDC called STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries). STEADI includes screening, assessing, and intervention. Interventions are recommendations that may reduce your risk of falling. During the screening, you may be asked several questions including: Have you fallen in the past year? Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? Are you worried about falling? During an assessment, your provider will test your strength, balance, and gait, using the following fall assessment tools: Timed Up-and-Go (Tug). This test checks your gait. You'll start in a chair, stand up, and then walk for about 10 feet at your regular pace. Then you'll sit down again. Your health care provider will check how long it takes you to do this. If it takes you 12 seconds or more, it may mean you are at higher risk for a fall. 30-Second Chair Stand Test. This test checks strength and balance. You'll sit in a chair with your arms crossed over your chest. When your provider says "go," you'll stand up and sit down again. You'll repeat this for 30 seconds. Your provider will count how many times you can do this. A lower number may mean you are at higher risk for a fall. The specific number that indicates a risk depends on your age. 4-Stage Balance Test. This test checks how well you can keep your balance. You'll stand in four different positions, holding each one for 10 seconds. The positions will get harder as you go.

Position 1: Stand with your feet side-by-side.
Position 2: Move one foot halfway forward, so the instep is touching the big toe of your other foot.
Position 3 Move one foot fully in front of the other, so the toes are touching the heel of your other foot.
Position 4: Stand on one foot.

 Position 1: Stand with your feet side-by-side. Position 2: Move one foot halfway forward, so the instep is touching the big toe of your other foot. Position 3 Move one foot fully in front of the other, so the toes are touching the heel of your other foot. Position 4: Stand on one foot. If you can't hold position 2 or position 3 for 10 seconds or you can't stand on one leg for 5 seconds, it may mean you are at higher risk for a fall. There are many other fall assessment tools. If your provider recommends other assessments, he or she will let you know what to expect.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a fall risk assessment? You don't need any special preparations for a fall risk assessment.1Are there any risks to a fall risk assessment? There is a small risk that you may fall as you do the assessment.1What do the results mean? The results may show you have a low, moderate, or high risk of falling. They also may show which areas need addressing (gait, strength, and/or balance). Based on your results, your health care provider may make recommendations to reduce your risk of falling. These may include: Exercising to improve your strength and balance. You may be given instructions on specific exercises or be referred to a physical therapist. Changing or reducing the dose of medicines that may be affecting your gait or balance. Some medicines have side effects that cause dizziness, drowsiness, or confusion. Taking vitamin D to strengthen your bones. Getting your vision checked by an eye doctor. Looking at your footwear to see if any of your shoes might increase your risk of falling. You may be referred to a podiatrist (foot doctor). Reviewing your home for potential hazards. These may include poor lighting, loose rugs, and/or cords on the floor. This review may be done by yourself, a partner, an occupational therapist, or other health care provider. If you have questions about your results and/or recommendations, talk to your health care provider.11References American Nurse Today [Internet]. HealthCom Media; c2019.

If your health care provider has told you to fast before a blood test, it means you should not eat or drink anything, except water, for several hours before your test. When you eat and drink normally, those foods and beverages are absorbed into your bloodstream. That could affect the results of certain types of blood tests.1What types of blood tests require fasting? The most common types of tests that require fasting include: Glucose tests, which measure blood sugar. One type of glucose test is called a glucose tolerance test. For this test you will need to fast for 8 hours before test. When you arrive at the lab or health care facility, you will:


Have your blood tested
Drink a special liquid containing glucose
Have your blood re-tested one hour later, two hours later and possibly three hours later

 Have your blood tested Drink a special liquid containing glucose Have your blood re-tested one hour later, two hours later and possibly three hours later Glucose tests are used to diagnose diabetes. Lipid tests, which measure triglycerides, a type of fat found in the bloodstream, and cholesterol, waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood and every cell of your body. High levels of triglycerides and/or a type of cholesterol, called LDL can put you at risk for heart disease.1How long do I have to fast before the test? You usually need to fast for 8–12 hours before a test. Most tests that require fasting are scheduled for early in the morning. That way, most of your fasting time will be overnight.1Can I drink anything besides water during a fast? No. Juice, coffee, soda, and other beverages can get in your bloodstream and affect your results. In addition, you should not: Chew gum Smoke Exercise These activities can also affect your results. But you can drink water. It's actually good to drink water before a blood test. It helps keep more fluid in your veins, which can make it easier to draw blood.1Can I continue taking medicine during a fast? Ask your health care provider. Most of the time it's OK to take your usual medicines, but you may need to avoid certain medicines, especially if they need to be taken with food.1What if I make a mistake and have something to eat or drink besides water during my fast? Tell your health care provider before your test. He or she can reschedule the test for another time when you are able to complete your fast.1When can I eat and drink normally again? As soon as your test is over. You may want to bring a snack with you, so you can eat right away.1Is there anything else I need to know about fasting before a blood test? Be sure to talk to your health care provider if you have any questions or concerns about fasting. You should talk to your provider before taking any lab test. Most tests don't require fasting or other special preparations. For others, you may need to avoid certain foods, medicines, or activities. Taking the right steps before testing helps ensure your results will be accurate.1References Allina Health [Internet].

A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) looks at a sample of your stool (poop) to check for blood. Occult blood means that you can't see it with the naked eye. And fecal means that it is in your stool. Blood in your stool means there is bleeding in the digestive tract. The bleeding may be caused by a variety of conditions, including: Polyps, abnormal growths on the lining of the colon or rectum Hemorrhoids, swollen veins in your anus or rectum Diverticulosis, a condition with small pouches in the inside wall of the colon Ulcers, sores in the lining of the digestive tract Colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease Colorectal cancer, a type of cancer that starts in the colon or rectum Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the United States. A fecal occult blood test can screen for colorectal cancer to help find the disease early when treatment may be most effective. Other names: FOBT, stool occult blood, occult blood test, Hemoccult test, guaiac smear test, gFOBT, immunochemical FOBT, iFOBT; FIT1What is it used for? A fecal occult blood test is commonly used as a screening test to help find colorectal cancer before you have symptoms. The test also has other uses. It may be done when there is concern about bleeding in the digestive tract from other conditions. In certain cases, the test is used to help find the cause of anemia. And it can help tell the difference between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which usually doesn't cause bleeding, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is likely to cause bleeding. But a fecal occult blood test alone cannot diagnose any condition. If your test results show blood in your stool, you will likely need other tests to diagnose the exact cause.1Why do I need a fecal occult blood test? Your health care provider may order a fecal occult blood test if you have symptoms of a condition that could involve bleeding in your digestive tract. Or you may have the test to screen for colorectal cancer when you don't have any symptoms. Expert medical groups strongly recommend that people get regular screening tests for colorectal cancer. Most medical groups recommend that you start screening tests at age 45 or 50 if you have an average risk of developing colorectal cancer. They recommend regular testing until at least age 75. Talk with your provider about your risk for colorectal cancer and when you should get a screening test. A fecal occult blood test is one or several types of colorectal screening tests. Other tests include: A stool DNA test. This test checks your stool for blood and cells with genetic changes that may be a sign of cancer. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Both tests use a thin tube with a camera to look inside your colon. A colonoscopy allows your provider to see your entire colon. A sigmoidoscopy shows only the lower part of your colon. CT colonography, also called "virtual colonoscopy." For this test, you usually drink a dye before having a CT scan that uses x-rays to take detailed 3-dimensional pictures of your entire colon and rectum. There are pros and cons of each type of test. Your provider can help you figure out which test is right for you.1What happens during a fecal occult blood test? Usually, your provider will give you a kit to collect samples of your stool (poop) at home. The kit will include instructions on how to do the test. There are two main types of fecal occult blood tests: The guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) uses a chemical (guaiac) to find blood in stool. It usually requires stool samples from two or three separate bowel movements. The fecal immunochemical test (iFOBT or FIT) uses antibodies to find blood in stool. Research shows that FIT testing is better at finding colorectal cancers than gFOBT testing. A FIT test requires stool samples from one to three separate bowel movements, depending on the brand of the test. It's very important to follow the instructions that come with your test kit. The typical process for gathering a stool sample usually includes these general steps: Collecting a bowel movement. Your kit may include a special paper to place over your toilet to catch your bowel movement. Or you may use plastic wrap or a clean, dry container. If you are doing a guaiac test, be careful not to let any urine mix in with your stool. Taking a stool sample from the bowel movement. Your kit will include a wooden stick or applicator brush for scraping the stool sample from your bowel movement. Follow the instructions for where to gather the sample from the stool. Preparing the stool sample. You will either smear the stool on a special test card or insert the applicator with the stool sample into a tube that came with your kit. Labeling and sealing the sample as directed. Repeating the test on your next bowel movement as directed if more than one sample is needed. Mailing the samples as directed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? A fecal immunochemical test (FIT) does not require any preparation, but a guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) does. Before you have a gFOBT test, your provider may ask you to avoid certain foods and medicines that may affect the results of the test. For seven days before the test, you may need to avoid: Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin. If you take aspirin for heart problems, talk with your provider before stopping your medicine. You may be able to take acetaminophen during this time but check with your provider before taking it. Vitamin C in amounts over 250 mg a day. This includes vitamin C from supplements, fruit juices, or fruit. For three days before the test, you may need to avoid: Red meat, such as beef, lamb, and pork. Traces of blood from these meats may show up in your stool.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a fecal occult blood test.1What do the results mean? If your results from a fecal occult blood test show that you have blood in your stool, it means you likely have bleeding somewhere in your digestive tract. But that doesn't always mean you have cancer. Other conditions that may cause blood in your stool include ulcers, hemorrhoids, polyps, and benign (not cancer) tumors. If you have blood in your stool, your provider will likely recommend more tests to figure out the exact location and cause of your bleeding. The most common follow-up test is a colonoscopy. If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a fecal occult blood test? Regular colorectal cancer screenings, such as fecal occult blood tests, are an important tool in the fight against cancer. Studies show that screening tests can help find cancer early and may reduce deaths from the disease. If you decide to use fecal occult blood testing for your colorectal cancer screening, you will need to do the test every year. You can buy gFOBT and FIT stool collection kits without a prescription. Most of these tests require you to send a sample of your stool to a lab. But some tests can be done completely at home for quick results. If you're considering buying your own test, ask your provider which one is best for you.1References American Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: American Cancer Society Inc.; c2022.

A ferritin blood test measures the level of ferritin in your blood. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron inside your cells. You need iron to make healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organs, including brain development in children. Too little or too much iron in your body can cause serious health problems if not treated. A ferritin blood test can show how much iron you have stored in your body. Other names: serum ferritin, serum ferritin level, ferritin serum1What is it used for? A ferritin blood test is used to help check your iron levels. It can help your health care provider find out if your body is storing the right amount of iron to stay healthy. The test may also be used to: Help diagnose or rule out conditions related to iron levels, including:

Hemochromatosis, having too much iron in your body (also called iron overload)
Iron deficiency anemia, having too few red blood cells because you lack iron
Liver diseases (much of the ferritin in your body is stored in your liver.)
Restless legs syndrome, a tingling or burning feelings in your legs that may be caused by a lack of iron
Adult Still disease (also called adult-onset Still disease or AOSD), an uncommon disease that causes joint pain, fever, and rash, often with high ferritin levels

 Hemochromatosis, having too much iron in your body (also called iron overload) Iron deficiency anemia, having too few red blood cells because you lack iron Liver diseases (much of the ferritin in your body is stored in your liver.) Restless legs syndrome, a tingling or burning feelings in your legs that may be caused by a lack of iron Adult Still disease (also called adult-onset Still disease or AOSD), an uncommon disease that causes joint pain, fever, and rash, often with high ferritin levels Monitor chronic (long-lasting) conditions that may affect your irons levels, such as cancer, kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases If you're being treated for problems with iron, the test may be used to check how well the treatment is working.1Why do I need a ferritin blood test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of iron levels that are too low or too high. Symptoms of iron levels that are too low include: Shortness of breath Weakness or fatigue Dizziness Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Symptoms of iron levels that are too high can vary and tend to get worse over time. Symptoms may include: Weakness or fatigue Joint pain, commonly in the knees or hands Loss of interest in sex or erectile dysfunction (ED) Abdominal (belly) pain Change in skin color, which may look gray, metallic, or bronze You may also need this test if the results of other blood tests show that you have low hematocrit or hemoglobin levels.1What happens during a ferritin blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your health care provider may ask you to fast (not eat or drink) for 12 hours before your test. The test is usually done in the morning. If you have any questions about how to prepare for your test, talk to your health care provider.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Lower than normal ferritin levels may mean you have iron deficiency anemia, or another condition related to low iron levels. Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia, in which your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. Without treatment it can lead to heart problems, infections, slow growth and brain development in children, and other health issues. Higher than normal ferritin levels can mean you have too much iron in your body. Conditions that cause increased iron levels include: Liver disease Alcohol use disorder Hemochromatosis  Hyperthyroidism If your ferritin results are not normal, it does not always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines can decrease or increase your ferritin levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a ferritin blood test? Most conditions that cause too little or too much iron can be successfully treated with medicines, diet, and/or other therapies.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is the term used to describe a group of conditions that can happen to a child whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it passes through the placenta, the organ that nourishes an unborn baby in the uterus. There is no amount of alcohol that's known to be safe to drink during pregnancy. If you are or think you may be pregnant, you should not drink alcohol. That includes hard liquor, beer, and wine. An unborn baby's exposure to alcohol can lead to lifelong physical, emotional, and behavioral problems. The term FASDs includes all of the following conditions: Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). This condition can affect organ development. People with ARBD may have problems with the function of their heart, kidneys, hearing, vision, and/or bones. They may also have other types of FASDs. Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE). People with this condition can have problems with mental health, memory, communication, impulse control, and skills of daily living. Alcohol-related Neurodevelopment Disorder (ARND). People with ARND have problems with the brain and nervous system. It can cause intellectual disabilities, and/or behavioral and learning problems. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). This is the most severe type of FASD. It causes both birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS). People with pFAS have some of the symptoms of an FASD. But the condition is not as severe as the other disorders. Other names: fetal alcohol syndrome screening, fetal alcohol 4-digit diagnostic code1What is it used for? The screening is used to find out if a child has an FASD. There is no cure for FASDs, but early diagnosis and treatment may help reduce some of the symptoms and help children reach their full potential.1Why does my child need an FASDs screening? A screening may be needed if you drank alcohol during your pregnancy and/or your child has symptoms of an FASD. Symptoms may include a mix of physical problems, intellectual disabilities, and problems coping with daily living. They can range from mild to severe and will vary depending on the child's age. Symptoms of FASDs may include a combination of the following: Abnormal facial features. These include small eyes, a thin upper lip, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip. Lower than average height and weight Poor coordination Vision and hearing problems Intellectual disability Delayed development Difficulty concentrating Hyperactivity Poor social skills1What happens during an FASDs screening? There is no single test for FASDs. But your provider may: Check for intellectual disabilities and developmental delays Look for certain physical features such as a small head, small eyes, and thin upper lip See if the child's weight and height are below normal Look for behavioral symptoms such as short attention span and problems with impulse control Check the child's coordination, vision, and hearing  Short palpebral fissure, the opening between the eye and eyelid Smooth philtrum, the ridge between the nose and upper lip Thin upper lip Lower than normal height and weight1Will my child need to do anything to prepare for this test? There are no special preparations needed for an FASD screening.1Are there any risks to this test? There are no risks to having an FASDs screening.1What do the results mean? If your child is diagnosed with an FASD, your provider may recommend several treatment options. There is no cure for these disorders, but the following may greatly improve a child's development and quality of life: Working with a team of providers that can include a special education teacher, speech therapist, physical and occupational therapists, and mental health professionals Special services in school to help with learning and behavior difficulties Behavior modification therapy Mental health therapy Social skill training Vocational and life skill therapy Medicines to help with some symptoms1Is there anything else I need to know about an FASDs screening? If you're the mother of a child with an FASD and think you have a problem with alcohol use, talk to your health care provider. Your provider can recommend counseling and treatment programs. Treatment may help you become a better parent and prevent future pregnancies from being affected.1References Astley SJ.

Flu is short for influenza, a respiratory infection caused by a virus. A flu test helps your health care provider find out if you have the flu. If do you have the flu, your provider may prescribe medicine to help fight the virus, if needed. The medicine is called antiviral medicine. It works best when started within two days after you first feel sick. Antiviral medicine may help lessen flu symptoms and shorten the time you're sick by about one day. The flu is most common during certain times of the year, known as flu season. In the United States, flu season can begin as early as October and end as late as May. The virus usually spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing. You can also get the flu by touching a surface that has the flu virus on it, and then touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. Most people who get the flu will feel sick with muscle aches, fever, and other uncomfortable symptoms. They usually recover in a week or two. For certain people, such as children under age 5, adults age 65 and over, and people with long-lasting health conditions, the flu can cause very serious illness, and even death. There are different types of flu tests: Rapid influenza antigen tests, or rapid influenza diagnostic tests are the most common type of flu test. This rapid test can provide results in less than half an hour, but it is not as accurate as other types of flu tests. Molecular flu tests are more accurate tests than rapid tests. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a common type of molecular test. Some molecular tests provide rapid results. But the most accurate tests require sending a sample of fluid from your nose or mouth to a special lab for testing, so you will have to wait longer for the results. Molecular tests may be used to confirm the results of a rapid test. Other names: rapid flu test, influenza antigen test, rapid influenza diagnostic test, RIDT, Flu PCR1What is it used for? Flu tests are used to help you find out whether you have the flu.  Flu tests are also used to watch for flu outbreaks in the community and for identifying the type of flu virus that is causing the infection.1Why do I need a flu test? If you have flu symptoms, your provider can help you decide whether you need a flu test. Fever Chills Muscle or body aches Fatigue Headache Runny or stuffy nose Sore throat Cough Even if you have flu symptoms, you may not need a flu test. If the flu is widespread in your area, your provider may be able to diagnose you without a test. Your provider may be more likely to order a flu test if you have a high risk for developing a more serious illness from the flu, such as pneumonia.  Your risk may be higher if you: Have a weakened immune system Are pregnant Are over the age of 65 Are under the age of 5 Have or have had cancer Have a chronic (long-lasting) health condition, such as asthma or diabetes Are in the hospital1What happens during a flu test? A flu test requires a sample of fluid from your nose or throat. There are two ways to collect a sample for testing: Swab test. Your provider will use a special swab to take a sample from your nose or throat. Nasal aspirate or wash. Your provider will insert a saline solution (salt water) into your nose and use gentle suction to remove it. At-home tests are also available for flu testing. It's very important to follow all the instructions that come with your test kit. There are two types of at-home tests: Rapid tests are done completely at home. To do the test, you usually swab your nose to collect the sample. Results are ready in under a half hour. Self-collection tests provide a kit to collect a fluid sample to send to a lab for testing. The sample is usually a nasal swab or a saliva sample. These tests tend to be more accurate than the rapid tests you do at home, but it may take days to get your results. Some home tests look for both flu and COVID-19. If you're considering a home flu test, your provider can help you choose the best test for your situation.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a flu test.1Are there any risks to the test? If your throat or nose is swabbed, you may feel a gagging sensation or even a tickle. A nasal aspirate or wash may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.1What do the results mean? A positive test result means you may have the flu. It's possible to have a false positive, which means your test says you have the flu, but you really don't.  Depending on your health, your provider may prescribe medicine to help prevent the flu from becoming a more serious illness. A negative result means you may not have the flu. A different virus or bacteria may be causing your symptoms. But the flu can't be ruled out. That's because a false negative is possible. That means your test says you don't have the flu, but you really do. Rapid tests tend to have more false negatives than tests that are sent to a lab. False negatives may also happen if your test was done after the amount of flu virus in your body began to decrease. If you have a high risk for getting seriously sick from the flu, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicine even though your test result was negative. You may also need other tests to help make a diagnosis. Some tests look for the flu and other viruses. If you had a test for more than one virus, the results will be listed separately for each type of virus. If you have questions about your results, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a flu test? Getting a yearly flu vaccine (flu shot) is your best protection against serious illness from the flu.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the vaccine for most people 6 months or older. If you have questions about the flu vaccine, talk with your health care provider.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Fluoroscopy is a type of x-ray that shows organs, tissues, or other internal structures moving in real time. Standard x-rays are like still photographs. Fluoroscopy is like a movie. It shows body systems in action. These include the cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels), digestive, and reproductive systems. The procedure can help your health care provider evaluate and diagnose a variety of conditions.1What is it used for? Fluoroscopy is used in many types of imaging procedures. The most common uses of fluoroscopy include: Barium swallow or barium enema. In these procedures, fluoroscopy is used to show the movement of the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract. Cardiac catheterization. In this procedure, fluoroscopy shows blood flowing through the arteries. It is used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. Placement of catheter or stent inside the body. Catheters are thin, hollow tubes. They are used to get fluids into the body or to drain excess fluids from the body. Stents are devices that help open narrow or blocked blood vessels. Fluoroscopy helps ensure proper placement of these devices. Guidance in orthopedic surgery. Fluoroscopy may be used by a surgeon to help guide procedures such as joint replacement and fracture (broken bone) repair. Hysterosalpingogram. In this procedure, fluoroscopy is used to provide images of a woman's reproductive organs.1Why do I need fluoroscopy? You may need a fluoroscopy if your provider wants to check the function of a particular organ, system, or other internal part of your body. You may also need fluoroscopy for certain medical procedures that require imaging.1What happens during fluoroscopy? Depending on the type of procedure, a fluoroscopy may be done at an outpatient radiology center or as part of your stay in a hospital. The procedure may include some or most of the following steps: You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown. You will be given a lead shield or apron to wear over your pelvic area or another part of your body, depending on the type of fluoroscopy. The shield or apron provides protection from unnecessary radiation. For certain procedures, you may be asked to drink a liquid containing contrast dye. Contrast dye is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray. If you are not asked to drink a liquid with the dye, you may be given the dye through an intravenous (IV) line or enema. An IV line will send the dye directly to your vein. An enema is procedure that flushes the dye into the rectum. You will be positioned on an x-ray table. Depending on the type of procedure, you may be asked to move your body in different positions or move a certain body part. You may also be asked to hold your breath for a brief period of time. If your procedure involves getting a catheter, your provider will insert a needle in the appropriate body part. This may be your groin, elbow, or other site. Your provider will use a special x-ray scanner to make the fluoroscopic images. If a catheter was placed, your provider will remove it. For certain procedures, such as those that involve injections into a joint or artery, you may first be given pain medicine and/or medicine to relax you.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your preparation will depend on the type of fluoroscopy procedure. For some procedures, you don't need any special preparations. For others, you may be asked to avoid certain medicines and/or to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if you need to do any special preparations.1Are there any risks to the test? You should not have a fluoroscopy procedure if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to an unborn baby. For others, there is little risk to having this test. The dose of radiation depends on the procedure, but fluoroscopy is not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time. If you will be having contrast dye, there is a small risk of an allergic reaction. Tell your provider if you have any allergies, especially to shellfish or iodine, or if you've ever had a reaction to contrast material.1What do the results mean? Your results will depend on what type of procedure you had. Several conditions and disorders can be diagnosed by fluoroscopy. Your provider may need to send your results to a specialist or do more tests to help make a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.11References American College of Radiology [Internet].

This test measures the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in your blood. FSH is made by your pituitary gland, a small gland located underneath the brain. FSH plays an important role in sexual development and functioning. In women, FSH helps control the menstrual cycle and stimulates the growth of eggs in the ovaries. FSH levels in women change throughout the menstrual cycle, with the highest levels happening just before an egg is released by the ovary. This is known as ovulation. In men, FSH helps control the production of sperm. Normally, FSH levels in men do not change very much. In children, FSH levels are usually low until puberty, when levels begin to rise. In girls, it helps signal the ovaries to make estrogen. In boys, it helps signal the testes to make testosterone. Too much or too little FSH can cause a variety of problems, including infertility (the inability to get pregnant), menstrual difficulties in women, low sex drive in men, and early or delayed puberty in children. Other names: follitropin, FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone: serum1What is it used for? FSH works closely with another hormone called luteinizing hormone to control sexual functions. So a luteinizing hormone test is often done along with an FSH test. These tests are used in different ways, depending on whether you are a woman, man, or child. In women, these tests are most often used to: Help find the cause of infertility Find out if there is a problem with ovarian function Find the reason for irregular or stopped menstrual periods Confirm the start of menopause, or perimenopause. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old. Perimenopause is the transition period before menopause. It can last for several years. FSH testing may be done towards the end of this transition. In men, these tests are most often used to: Help find the cause of infertility Find the reason for a low sperm count Find out if there is a problem with the testicles In children, these tests are most often used to help diagnose early or delayed puberty. Puberty is considered early if it starts before age 9 in girls and before age 10 in boys. Puberty is considered delayed if it hasn't started by age 13 in girls and by age 14 in boys.1Why do I need an FSH levels test? If you are a woman, you may need this test if: You've been unable to get pregnant after 12 months of trying. Your menstrual cycle is irregular. Your periods have stopped. The test may be used to find out if you have gone through menopause or are in perimenopause If you are a man, you may need this test if: You've been unable to get your partner pregnant after 12 months of trying. Your sex drive is decreased. Both men and women may need testing if they have symptoms of a pituitary disorder. These include some of the symptoms listed above, as well as: Fatigue Weakness Weight loss Decreased appetite Your child may need an FSH test if he or she does not seem to be starting puberty at the right age (either too early or too late).1What happens during an FSH levels test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you are a woman who has not gone through menopause, your provider may want to schedule your test at a specific time during your menstrual cycle.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The meaning of your results will depend on whether you are a woman, man, or child. If you are a woman, high FSH levels may mean you have: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure. POI is the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility. Started menopause or are in perimenopause An ovarian tumor Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects sexual development in females. It often causes infertility. If you are a woman, low FSH levels may mean: Your ovaries are not making enough eggs. Your pituitary gland is not working correctly. You have a problem with your hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls the pituitary gland and other important body functions. You are very underweight. If you are a man, high FSH levels may mean: Your testicles have been damaged due to chemotherapy, radiation, infection, or alcohol abuse. You have Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder affects sexual development in males. It often causes infertility. If you are a man, low FSH levels may mean you have a disorder of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. In children, high FSH levels, along with high levels of luteinizing hormone, may mean puberty is about to start or has already started. If this is happening before age 9 in a girl or before age 10 in a boy (precocious puberty), it may be a sign of: A disorder of the central nervous system A brain injury Low FSH and luteinizing hormone levels in children may be a sign of delayed puberty. Delayed puberty may be caused by: A disorder of the ovaries or testicles Turner syndrome in girls Klinefelter syndrome in boys An infection A hormone deficiency An eating disorder If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an FSH levels test? There is an at-home test that measures FSH levels in urine. The kit is designed for women who want to find out if certain symptoms such as irregular periods, vaginal dryness, and hot flashes may be due to menopause or perimenopause. The test can show whether you have high FSH levels, a sign of menopause or perimenopause. But it doesn't diagnose either condition. After taking the test, you should talk with your health care provider about the results.1References FDA: U.S. Food and Drug Administration [Internet].

A food allergy happens when your immune system - your body's defense against germs - overreacts to a certain food as if it was harmful. If you have symptoms after eating certain foods, food allergy testing can help find out if your symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction to those foods. And it's important to find out because allergic reactions to food can be serious. Most food allergy symptoms are mild and include skin rashes and abdominal (belly) pain. But sometimes, symptoms quickly develop into a life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may affect your whole body, including your breathing. And there's no way to predict when an allergic reaction may change from mild to serious. If you have a food allergy, eating even tiny amounts of a certain food or ingredient can quickly trigger your immune system to react. Most food allergies are caused by: Milk Eggs Peanuts Tree nuts (including almonds, walnuts, pecans, and cashews) Soy Wheat Fish Shellfish Food allergies are more common in children than adults. Most children will grow out of allergies to milk, egg, soy, and wheat. But if a food allergy begins in adulthood, it's likely to continue through life. If you or your child has symptoms that could be from a food allergy, your or your child's health care provider will probably refer you to an allergist for testing. An allergist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating allergies and asthma. The allergist will pick the type of food allergy test that's right for you or your child. Tests include skin tests, blood tests, and a test where you eat small amounts of a suspected food while a provider watches for signs of allergy. Other names: IgE test, sIgE test, allergen-specific IgE in serum, skin prick test (SPT), oral challenge test1What is it used for? Food allergy testing is used to help find out if you or your child has an allergy to a specific food. It is mainly used for people who have had symptoms that could be a food allergy. Testing may also be used to see if allergies have gone away over time. Food allergy testing can help tell whether you have a true food allergy or a food intolerance or food sensitivity, which may cause similar symptoms.  The key difference is that food allergies involve your immune system and can affect your whole body and become life-threatening. But food intolerance and sensitivity don't become life-threatening and generally affect only your digestion. Examples of food intolerances, or food sensitivities, include lactose intolerance, gluten sensitivity, and irritable bowel syndrome. The symptoms may include belly pain, nausea, gas, and diarrhea, which can also happen with food allergies.1Why do I need food allergy testing? You or your child may need food allergy testing if either of you: Have symptoms within minutes to hours after exposure to certain foods. Symptoms may affect your digestion, skin, and/or breathing, and may include:

Nausea and vomiting
Stomach pain
Diarrhea
Tingling in the mouth
Skin reactions, such as hives or itching.
Red, itchy skin or a rash
Coughing
Stuffy, itchy, or runny nose

 Nausea and vomiting Stomach pain Diarrhea Tingling in the mouth Skin reactions, such as hives or itching. Red, itchy skin or a rash Coughing Stuffy, itchy, or runny nose Have had symptoms of anaphylaxis. Symptoms of this life-threatening reaction may appear within minutes to hours after exposure to certain foods. Symptoms include:

Trouble breathing
Dizziness
Fainting
Swelling of the tongue, lips, and/or throat
Rapid heart rate
Cold, clammy, skin that may appear grayish, bluish, or pale

 Trouble breathing Dizziness Fainting Swelling of the tongue, lips, and/or throat Rapid heart rate Cold, clammy, skin that may appear grayish, bluish, or pale If someone has symptoms of anaphylaxis, call 911 to get medical help right away. You may also have food allergy testing if you or your child has been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Testing is done to find out which foods may make this condition worse. Your child's provider may recommend food allergy testing if your infant or child has been diagnosed with: Moderate to severe eczema Enterocolitis, inflammation of the colon and small intestine Enteropathy, a disease of the intestine Allergic proctocolitis, a disorder that involves streaks of blood and mucus in stool (poop)1What happens during food allergy testing? An allergist will ask about your or your child's symptoms, family health history, and medical history, including other allergies. A physical exam is usually done before allergy testing. Next, your allergist or another provider will do one or more allergy tests. There are many types of allergy tests, and they have different risks. So, ask your provider which tests are best for you or your child. These are the most common tests: A skin prick test is the most commonly used test. A provider will place a drop of liquid on the skin of your arm or back. The liquid contains a protein from a specific food that may trigger an immune reaction. The provider will prick the skin under the drop so the liquid gets below the surface. Then you'll wait for 15 to 30 minutes. If a red, itchy bump forms, you may have an allergy to that food. More than one food protein may be tested. A skin prick test is the most commonly used test. A provider will place a drop of liquid on the skin of your arm or back.

Then you'll wait for 15 to 30 minutes. If a red, itchy bump forms, you may have an allergy to that food. More than one food protein may be tested. An allergy blood test measures immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your blood. Your immune system makes specific types of IgE in response to different foods. If you have a food allergy, your levels of IgE related to that food may be higher than normal. But the amount of IgE in your blood can't confirm a food allergy or tell you how serious an allergy may be. A blood test may be done with other tests to confirm a food allergy.
To take blood sample, a health care professional will insert a small needle into a vein in your arm. A small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.

During this test, you will slowly eat increasing amounts of a food that's suspected of causing your symptoms. You'll be closely watched for an allergic reaction. If your body doesn't react to the food, you aren't allergic to it.
If you have an allergic reaction, your food allergy is confirmed, and you'll be treated right away for the reaction. The treatment will depend on how severe your reaction is.

The treatment will depend on how severe your reaction is. A food elimination diet is a test you do at home following instructions from your allergist. You'll start by removing all suspected foods from your diet for about two weeks. Then you'll slowly start adding the foods back to your diet, one at a time. If you have symptoms when you start eating a food again, you may be allergic to that food. Your symptoms could also be caused by a food intolerance, so other tests may be needed.
A food elimination diet may not be safe for someone who has had a serious allergic reaction to food in the past.

If you are having any type of allergy test, you may need to stop taking certain medicines and/or supplements before the test. Your provider will let you know what to avoid and for how long. Don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to. Your test may require other preparation, so be sure to follow all your provider's instructions for getting ready.1Are there any risks to the test? A skin prick test can cause itchy or irritated skin. Your allergist may recommend medicine to relieve the symptoms. The test is generally safe, but a severe reaction is possible. A blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. An oral challenge test can cause a severe allergic reaction. That's why this test is done with close supervision by an allergist who can treat you if there is an emergency. An elimination diet may cause a serious allergic reaction. Ask your allergist what to do if you develop symptoms.1What do the results mean? A food challenge test is the only food allergy test that can confirm a diagnosis of a food allergy. If you have other tests, your or your child's allergist will use your test results along with your symptoms and medical history to make a diagnosis. If the allergist diagnoses a food allergy, the treatment is to avoid the food that trigger your symptoms. There is no cure for food allergies. Avoiding trigger foods involves carefully reading food labels. You'll also need to explain the allergy to anyone who may prepare or serve food to you or your child, including friends, waiters, babysitters, and teachers. Your allergist will tell you how to manage a mild allergic reaction. In case you or your child has a severe allergic reaction, your allergist may prescribe an autoinjector. An autoinjector is a small device that you use to inject an emergency allergy medicine, called epinephrine. If you need to use the device, it's still very important to get medical help right away even if you feel better. Your allergist will explain when and how to use an autoinjector. If you have questions about test results and/or how to manage allergic reactions, talk with your allergist. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Aceves SS. Allergy Testing in Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/te7016 Free Light Chains : 1What is a free light chains test? Light chains are proteins made by plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. Plasma cells also make immunoglobulins (antibodies). Immunoglobulins help protect the body against illness and infections. Immunoglobulins are formed when light chains link up with heavy chains, another type of protein. When light chains link up with heavy chains, they are known as bound light chains. Normally, plasma cells make a small amount of extra light chains that don't bind with heavy chains. They are instead released into the bloodstream. These unlinked chains are known as free light chains. There are two types of light chains: lambda and kappa light chains. A free light chains test measures the amount of lambda and kappa free light chains in the blood. If the amount of free light chains is higher or lower than normal, it can mean you have a disorder of the plasma cells. These include multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells, and amyloidosis, a condition that causes a dangerous buildup of proteins in different organs and tissues. Other names: free kappa/lambda ratio, kappa/lambda quantitative free light, freelite, kappa and lambda free light chains, immunoglobulin free light chains1What is it used for? A free light chains test is used to help diagnose or monitor plasma cell disorders.1Why do I need a free light chains test? You may need this test  if you have symptoms of a plasma cell disorder. Depending on which plasma disorder you may have and which organs are affected, your symptoms may include: Bone pain Fatigue Numbness or tingling in arms and legs Tongue swelling Purple spots on the skin1What happens during a free light chains test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a free light chains test.1Are there any risks to a free light chains test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will show amounts for lambda and kappa free light chains. It will also provide a comparison between the two. If your results were not normal, it may mean you have a plasma cell disorder, such as: Multiple myeloma Amyloidosis MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance). This is a condition in which you have abnormal protein levels. It often causes no problems or symptoms, but sometimes it develops into multiple myeloma. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), a cancer of the white blood cells. It's a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a free light chains test? A free light chains test is often ordered with other tests, including an immunofixation blood test, to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

A fungal culture test helps diagnose fungal infections. Fungal infections may happen if you are exposed to fungi (more than one fungus). Fungi are plant-like life forms, such as yeasts and molds. Fungi live everywhere: Outdoors in air and soil and on plants Indoors on surfaces and in the air On your skin and inside your body Normally, if you are healthy, fungi will not make you sick. But there are a few hundred types of fungi that can affect your health. There are two main types of fungal infections: Superficial fungal infections affect the outside of your body, including your skin, genital area, and nails. They are very common. Usually, these fungal infections aren't serious, but they can cause itchy, scaly rashes, and other uncomfortable conditions. Examples of superficial fungal infections include: Athlete's foot Vaginal yeast infections Jock itch Ringworm, which causes a circle-shaped rash on the skin that looks like a coiled worm Systemic fungal infections affect tissue inside your body. The fungus may grow in your lungs, blood, and other organs, including your brain. Anyone can get a systemic fungal infection, but they are less common in healthy people. In healthy people, the infection begins slowly and usually doesn't spread to other organs. The most serious systemic fungal infections happen in people who have medical conditions that weaken the immune system or need treatment that affects the immune system. These infections tend to spread faster and affect more than one part of the body. Examples of systemic fungal infections include: Aspergillosis. Histoplasmosis. Pneumocystis pneumonia. Sporothrix schenckii, or "rose gardener's disease," a fungus that lives in soil and on plants and enters the skin through small cuts and scrapes. It can affect the skin, lungs, joints, and nervous system. Both superficial and systemic fungal infections can be diagnosed with a fungal culture test.1What is it used for? A fungal culture test is used to find out whether you have a fungal infection. The test may help identify the type of fungus that you have. The test is also used to help guide treatment and to see if  treatment is working.1Why do I need a fungal culture test? Your health care provider may order a fungal culture test if you have symptoms of a fungal infection. The symptoms vary depending on the type of infection. Symptoms of a superficial fungal infection include: Red rash Itchy, scaly, or cracked skin Hair loss Itching and/or discharge from the vagina (symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection) White patches inside the mouth (symptoms of a mouth yeast infection, called thrush) Nails that are discolored (yellow, brown, or white), thick, or brittle nails Symptoms of a more serious, systemic fungal infection include: Cough, chest pain, or shortness of breath Fever Joint and muscle aches Headaches Chills Nausea and vomiting Fatigue Fast heartbeat1What happens during a fungal culture test? Fungi can infect different parts of the body. To do a fungal culture test you will need to provide a sample of cells or fluid from the part of your body where the fungi may be growing. The most common types of fungal tests are: Skin or nail scraping Used to diagnose superficial skin or nail infections How it's done:


Your provider will use a special tool to take a small sample of your skin or nails. In certain cases, a skin biopsy may be needed.

 Your provider will use a special tool to take a small sample of your skin or nails. In certain cases, a skin biopsy may be needed. Swab test Used to diagnose yeast infections in your mouth or vagina. It may also be used to diagnose certain skin infections. How it's done:


Your provider will use a special swab to gather tissue or fluid from your mouth, vagina, or from an open skin sore.

 Your provider will use a special swab to gather tissue or fluid from your mouth, vagina, or from an open skin sore. Blood Test Used to find fungi in the blood. Blood tests are often used to diagnose more serious fungal infections. How it's done:


A health care professional will collect a blood sample. The sample is most often taken from a vein in your arm.

 A health care professional will collect a blood sample. The sample is most often taken from a vein in your arm. Urine Test Used to diagnose more serious infections and sometimes to help diagnose a vaginal yeast infection How it's done:


You will collect a sterile sample of urine in a container, as instructed by your provider.

 You will collect a sterile sample of urine in a container, as instructed by your provider. Sputum Culture Sputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva. Used to help diagnose fungal infections in the lungs How it's done:


You may be asked to cough up sputum into a special container as instructed by your provider.

 You may be asked to cough up sputum into a special container as instructed by your provider. After your sample is collected, it will be sent to a lab for analysis. You may not get your results right away. That's because the sample usually needs time to grow so that there's enough to test. Many types of fungi grow within a day or two, and other types can take a few weeks.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations to test for a fungal infection.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having any of the fungal culture tests. If a sample of your skin is taken, you may have a little bleeding or soreness at the site. If you get a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If fungi are found in your sample, it likely means you have a fungal infection. Sometimes a fungal culture can identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection. But your provider may need to order other tests to make a diagnosis. Sometimes more testing is needed to help find the right medicine to treat your infection. These tests are called "sensitivity" or "susceptibility" tests. They check to see if which medicine will kill the fungus or stop it from growing. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a fungal culture test? If you are being treated for a fungal infection, be sure to take all your medicine as prescribed, even if you feel better. Many fungal infections clear up within a few days to weeks, but some infections require months or even years of treatment.1References Allina Health [Internet]. Minneapolis: Allina Health.

Spectrum of Mycoses. In: Baron S, editor. Medical Microbiology. 4th edition. Galveston (TX): University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston; 1996. Chapter 75. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7902/ G6PD Test : 1What is a G6PD test? This test measures the amount of G6PD in the blood. G6PD stands for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that helps red blood cells work properly. Red blood cells move oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. If you don't have enough G6PD, it's known as G6PD deficiency. This is a genetic disorder that mostly affects males. G6PD deficiency can cause the destruction of red blood cells. When red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them, it's called hemolytic anemia. If you have hemolytic anemia, your cells don't get all the oxygen they need. Most people with G6PD deficiency don't have symptoms of disease until they are exposed to certain "triggers," which set off the destruction of red blood cells. Triggers include: Fava beans, also called broad beans Viral infections Bacterial infections Certain antibiotics Anti-malaria medicines Other medicines, including nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin Other names: G6PD deficiency test, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase test1What is it used for? A G6PD test is used to check for a G6PD deficiency (not enough G6PD).1Why do I need a G6PD test? You may need a G6PD test if you have symptoms of hemolytic anemia. These include: Fatigue Pale skin or jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Dark or yellow-orange colored urine Your newborn baby might need a G6PD test if he or she has jaundice that doesn't go away in two weeks and/or is not explained by another condition. Your baby may also be tested if you have a family history of G6PD deficiency.1What happens during a G6PD test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. If your baby is being tested, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? There are no special preparations needed for a G6PD test.1Are there any risks to this test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show you have lower than normal amounts of G6PD, it means you have a G6PD deficiency. But your symptoms and risk of getting hemolytic anemia can vary depending on your personal health history and exposure to triggers. Women who have slightly lower than normal amounts of G6PD may be "carriers" of a G6PD deficiency. That means they have one defective G6PD gene and one normal G6PD gene. These women rarely have symptoms, as their normal G6PD genes usually make enough healthy red blood cells.  But they have a risk of passing on the defective gene to their children.  Male children are more likely to develop G6PD symptoms than female children. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a G6PD test? Most people with G6PD deficiency can manage their condition and prevent symptoms by avoiding triggering substances. Your health care provider can help you figure out which substances to avoid.1References Frank JE. Diagnosis and management of G6PD deficiency.

A galactosemia test is a blood test given to newborns to check for a rare genetic disorder called galactosemia. This disorder prevents the body from breaking down a simple sugar called galactose. Galactose is found in many foods and all dairy products. This includes breast milk and milk-based baby formulas. Normally, certain enzymes break down galactose. Galactosemia happens when a genetic change affects the function of these enzymes. There are three types of galactosemia. The type depends on which enzyme is affected: GALT (galactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase) deficiency. This is also known as classic galactosemia. It is the most common and severe form of the disorder. GALK (galactose kinase) deficiency GALE (galactose epimerase) deficiency If a baby with a GALT, GALK, or GALE deficiency eats food with galactose, high levels of sugar build up in the blood. This can lead to serious health problems. These include liver disease, kidney failure, brain damage, and even death. But with early diagnosis and treatment, children with galactosemia can live healthy lives. Other names: galactosemia newborn screening test, GALT test1What is it used for? A galactosemia test is used to help diagnose galactosemia in a baby. It may also help identify whether it is a GALT, GALK, or GALE deficiency.1Why does my baby need a galactosemia test? Newborns in the United States are required to get this test as part of a newborn screening. A newborn screening is a simple blood test that checks for a variety of serious diseases. Some older infants may need testing if they were adopted from another country and have symptoms of galactosemia. These include: Vomiting Poor weight gain Refusal to eat Irritability Jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and eyes to turn yellow1What happens during a galactosemia test? A health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? There are no special preparations needed for a galactosemia test.1Are there any risks to this test? Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your baby's results will be either positive or negative for galactosemia. If the results are negative, your child doesn't have the disorder. If the results are positive, your baby will probably need more testing to confirm the diagnosis. These may include other blood tests, urine tests, and genetic tests. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a galactosemia test? There is no cure for galactosemia. Infants diagnosed with the disorder can be fed soy formula or certain other lactose-free formulas. Children with classic galactosemia (GALT) must keep a special diet that avoids all milk and products that contain milk. Children with GALK and GALE deficiencies may be able to include a limited amount of dairy in their diets. If your child has one of these deficiencies, talk to your child's provider about how to plan a safe and healthy diet, both in infancy and as your child grows up. Children with these deficiencies will probably need to stay on special diets for the rest of their lives.1References Baby's First Test [Internet]. Expecting Health; c2020.

A gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test measures the amount of GGT in the blood. GGT is an enzyme found throughout the body, but it is mostly found in the liver. When the liver is damaged, GGT may leak into the bloodstream. High levels of GGT in the blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile in and out of the liver. Bile is a fluid made by the liver. It is important for digestion. A GGT test can't diagnose the specific cause of liver disease. So it is usually done along with or after other liver function tests, most often an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test. ALP is another type of liver enzyme. It's often used to help diagnose bone disorders as well as liver disease. Other names: gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, GGTP, Gamma-GT, GTP1What is it used for? A GGT test is most often used to: Help diagnose liver disease Figure out if liver damage is due to liver disease or a bone disorder Check for blockages in the bile ducts Screen for or monitor alcohol use disorder1Why do I need a GGT test? You may need a GGT test if you have symptoms of liver disease. Symptoms include: Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Loss of appetite Abdominal pain or swelling Nausea and vomiting You may also need this test if you had abnormal results on an ALP test and/or other liver function tests.1What happens during a GGT test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a GGT test.1Are there any risks to a GGT test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show higher than normal levels of GGT, it may be a sign of liver damage. The damage may be due to one of the following conditions: Hepatitis Cirrhosis Alcohol use disorder Pancreatitis Diabetes Congestive heart failure Side effect of a drug. Certain medicines can cause liver damage in some people. The results can't tell you which condition is causing your liver damage. Usually, the higher the level of GGT, the greater the level of damage to the liver. If your results show you have low or normal levels of GGT, it means you probably don't have liver disease. Your results may also be compared with the results of an ALP test. ALP tests help diagnose bone disorders. Together your results may show one of the following: High levels of ALP and high levels of GGT means your symptoms are likely due to liver disorder and not a bone disorder. High levels of ALP and low or normal GGT means it's more likely you have a bone disorder. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a GGT test? In addition to an ALP test, your provider may order liver function tests along with or after the GGT test. These include: Alanine aminotransferase, or ALT Aspartate aminotransferase, or AST Lactic dehydrogenase, or LDH1References American Liver Foundation. [Internet].

Gastric emptying tests are tests that measure the time it takes for food to empty out of your stomach. After a meal, it normally takes 1 1/2 to two hours for food to move out of the stomach and into the small intestine. When your stomach takes longer than normal to empty, it's called gastroparesis. If food stays in your stomach for too long, it can harden into a solid mass called a bezoar. A bezoar may lead to a dangerous blockage that prevents food from passing into your small intestine. Gastroparesis may also cause malnutrition (not getting enough nutrients from your food). Gastric emptying tests may help you get treatment for gastroparesis before it causes serious complications. Other names: gastric emptying study, gastric emptying scan, gastric emptying scintigraphy, smart pill, wireless motility study, gastric emptying breath test, upper GI series, barium swallow1What are they used for? Gastric emptying tests are most often used to diagnose gastroparesis.1Why do I need a gastric emptying test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of gastroparesis, which include: Abdominal pain Bloating Nausea and vomiting A feeling of fullness after just a few bites of food Loss of appetite Weight loss1What happens during a gastric emptying test? Gastric emptying tests are most often done by a radiologist or radiology technician. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using imaging tests to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. There are different types of tests. You may have one or more of the following tests: Gastric emptying study, also known as a gastric emptying scan, or gastric emptying scintigraphy. This is the most common test used to diagnose gastroparesis. During this test: You will start by eating a light meal, often eggs and toast. The food will contain a small, harmless amount of radioactive material called a tracer. After you finish eating, you will lie down on an x-ray table. The radiologist will take images of your abdomen, using a scanning device. The radiologist will watch the movements of the radioactive tracer on a monitor. The tracer will show how food travels through your stomach. Additional images will be taken over the next few hours to see how long it takes for food to move out of your stomach and into your gastrointestinal tract. You will be allowed to get up and leave the exam room during this time period. Your provider will let you know when you need to return for imaging. It's usually at around 1, 2, and 4 hours after the first image was taken. A gastric emptying study may also be done using a liquid that contains the radioactive tracer, instead of solid food. Upper GI series, also known as a barium swallow. During this test: You will swallow a drink that contains barium. Barium is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray. You will lie on an x-ray table. A special type of x-ray called a fluoroscopy will track the barium in real time as it moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. You may be asked to change positions while more images are taken. Gastric emptying breath test. During this test: You will eat a meal or drink a liquid that contains a type of protein that your body absorbs. The substance eventually passes into your breath. A provider will collect samples of your breath over a period of about four hours. You may be able to leave the exam room during this time period but will need to sit quietly. You should not smoke or eat while you wait. Your provider will let you know when you need to return for imaging. The amount of the substance found in your breath samples can help show how fast the stomach has emptied. Smart pill, also known as a wireless motility capsule. During this test: You will swallow a smart pill, which is a small electronic device. You will then proceed with your normal daily activities. As you go through your day, the smart pill will travel through your gastrointestinal system and collect data. The data is sent to a receiver that you wear, usually around your waist. After a day or two, the smart pill will leave your body in a bowel movement. You may not feel it when it exits your body. So when you have bowel movement, wait 3 minutes before flushing This will ensure the receiver captures the data, even after the capsule leaves your body. After 4 or 5 days, you will return the receiver to the radiologist who will review the results.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Your provider will also let you know if you need to stop taking certain medicines before your test.1Are there any risks to the test?  You should not have a gastric emptying study or an upper GI series if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation from these imaging tests can be harmful to an unborn baby. For others, there is little risk to having an imaging test. The dose of radiation is very low and not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time. There is very little risk to having a gastric breath test or taking a smart pill. In rare cases, a smart pill may get stuck in the digestive system. If the pill takes longer than several days to leave your body in a bowel movement, contact your health provider.1What do the results mean? If your results show it took longer than normal for your stomach to empty, it probably means you have gastroparesis.1Is there anything else I need to know about gastric emptying tests? Treatment for gastroparesis may involve taking certain medicines and/or treating the condition that is causing the problem, such as diabetes. Regardless of the cause, your provider will likely recommend that you make changes to your diet and eating habits. These may include: Eating foods low in fiber and fat. Avoiding carbonated drinks, smoking, and alcohol. Eating smaller meals throughout the day, rather than two or three large meals. Chewing food thoroughly. Waiting at least two hours after eating before lying down.1References ACR: American College of Radiology [Internet].

Glaucoma tests are a group of tests that help diagnose glaucoma, a disease of the eye that can cause vision loss and blindness. Glaucoma happens when fluid builds up in the front part of the eye. The extra fluid causes an increase in eye pressure. Increased eye pressure can damage the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries information from the eye to the brain. When the optic nerve is damaged, it can lead to serious vision problems. There are several types of glaucoma. The main types are: Open-angle glaucoma, also called primary open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type of glaucoma. It happens when the fluid in the eye doesn't drain properly from the eye's drainage canals. The fluid gets backed up in the canals like a clogged sink drain that gets backed up with water. This causes an increase in eye pressure. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly, over a period of months or years. Most people don't have any symptoms or vision changes at first. Open-angle glaucoma usually affects both eyes at the same time. Closed-angle glaucoma, also called angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma. This type of glaucoma isn't common in the United States. It usually affects one eye at a time. In this type of glaucoma, drainage canals in the eyes get covered up, as if a stopper was put over a drain. Closed-angle glaucoma can be either acute or chronic.Acute closed-angle glaucoma causes a rapid increase in eye pressure. It is a medical emergency. People with acute closed-angle glaucoma can lose vision in a matter of hours if the condition is not treated promptly.Chronic closed-angle glaucoma develops slowly. In many cases, there are no symptoms until damage is severe. Acute closed-angle glaucoma causes a rapid increase in eye pressure. It is a medical emergency. People with acute closed-angle glaucoma can lose vision in a matter of hours if the condition is not treated promptly. Chronic closed-angle glaucoma develops slowly. In many cases, there are no symptoms until damage is severe.1What are they used for? Glaucoma tests are used to diagnose glaucoma. If glaucoma is diagnosed early, you may be able to take steps to prevent vision loss.1Why do I need glaucoma testing? If you have open-angle glaucoma, you may not have any symptoms until the disease becomes severe. So it's important to be tested if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk for glaucoma if you have a family history of glaucoma or if you are: Aged 60 or older. Glaucoma is much more common in older people. Hispanic and aged 60 or older. Hispanics in this age group have a higher risk of glaucoma compared with older adults with European ancestry. African American. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans. Asian. People of Asian descent are at higher risk for getting closed-angle glaucoma. Closed-angle glaucoma can cause sudden and severe symptoms. If not treated promptly, it can cause blindness. Symptoms include: Sudden blurring of vision Severe eye pain Red eyes Colored halos around lights Nausea and vomiting If you have any of these symptoms, seek medical help right away.1What happens during a glaucoma test? Glaucoma is usually diagnosed with a group of tests, commonly known as a comprehensive eye exam. These exams are most often done by an ophthalmologist. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in eye health and in treating and preventing eye disease. A comprehensive eye exam includes: Tonometry. In a tonometry test, you will sit in an exam chair next to a special microscope called a slit lamp. Your ophthalmologist or other health care provider will put drops in your eyes to numb them. Then you'll rest your chin and forehead onto the slit lamp. While you are leaning into the slit lamp, your provider will use a device on your eye called a tonometer. The device measures eye pressure. You will feel a small puff of air, but it won't hurt. Pachymetry. As in a tonometry test, you'll first get drops to numb your eye. Your provider will then use a small device on your eye called a pachymeter. This device measures the thickness of your cornea. The cornea is the eye's outer layer that covers the iris (colored part of the eye) and the pupil. A thin cornea may put you at higher risk for getting glaucoma. Perimetry, also known as a visual field test, measures your peripheral (side) vision. During perimetry, you'll be asked to look straight ahead at a screen. A light or image will move in from one side of the screen. You'll let the provider know when you see this light or image while still looking straight ahead. Dilated eye test. In this test, your provider will put drops in your eyes that widen (dilate) your pupils. Your provider will use a device with a light and magnifying lens to look at your optic nerve and check for damage. Gonioscopy. In this test, your provider will put drops in your eyes to both numb and dilate them. Then your provider will put a special hand-held contact lens on the eye. The lens has a mirror on it to let the doctor view the inside of the eye from different directions. It can show if the angle between the iris and cornea is too wide (a possible sign of open-angle glaucoma) or too narrow (a possible sign of closed-angle glaucoma).1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a glaucoma test? While your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurred and you'll be extra sensitive to light. These effects can last for several hours and vary in severity. To protect your eyes from bright light, you should bring sunglasses to wear after the appointment. You should also make arrangements for someone to drive you home, as your vision may be too impaired for safe driving.1Are there any risks to the tests? There is no risk to having glaucoma testing. Some of the tests may feel a bit uncomfortable. Also, dilation can temporarily blur your vision.1What do the results mean? Your ophthalmologist will look at the results of all your glaucoma tests to figure out whether you have glaucoma. If the doctor determines you have glaucoma, he or she may recommend one or more of the following treatments: Medicine to lower eye pressure or cause the eye to make less fluid. Some medicines are taken as eye drops; others are in pill form. Surgery to create a new opening for fluid to leave the eye. Drainage tube implant, another type of surgery. In this procedure, a flexible plastic tube is placed in the eye to help drain excess fluid. Laser surgery to remove excess fluid from the eye. Laser surgery is usually done in an ophthalmologist's office or outpatient surgery center. You may need to continue taking glaucoma medicines after laser surgery. If you've been diagnosed with glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will probably monitor your vision on a regular basis.1Is there anything else I need to know about glaucoma tests? While glaucoma treatments won't cure the disease or restore vision you have already lost, treatment can prevent additional vision loss. If diagnosed and treated early, most people with glaucoma will not have significant vision loss.1References American Academy of Ophthalmology [Internet].

They are made in your liver by your immune system. Globulins play an important role in liver function, blood clotting, and fighting infection. There are different types of globulins called alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. Tests to measure globulins include: Total protein test. This blood test measures the total amount of protein in your blood. The two main types of blood proteins are globulins and albumin. If protein levels are low, it can mean that you have liver or kidney disease. Serum protein electrophoresis. This blood test measures the level of each type of protein in your blood, including the different types of globulins. The levels of specific globulins provide information about how well your immune system is working. So, this test can be used to diagnose disorders of the immune system, a type of cancer called multiple myeloma, and a variety of other conditions. Other names for globulin tests: Serum globulin electrophoresis, total protein1What is it used for? Globulin tests can be used to help diagnose a variety of conditions, including: Liver damage or disease Kidney disease Nutritional problems Certain autoimmune disorders Certain types of cancer1Why do I need a globulin test? Your health care provider may order globulin tests: As part of your regular checkup To help diagnose specific conditions when you have symptoms To monitor liver or kidney problems A total protein test may be included in a comprehensive metabolic panel, which is often part of a routine checkup. Your provider may order the test if you have symptoms of kidney or liver disease. If your provider thinks you may have a liver disease, a total protein test may be done with other  tests that check how well your liver is working. These tests are called liver function tests. Your provider may order them if you are at risk for liver disease or have symptoms of liver disease, which may include: Nausea and vomiting Lack of appetite Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly) Swelling in your ankles and legs Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop) Frequent itching A serum protein electrophoresis test measures the levels of the different types of globulins and other proteins in your blood. Your provider may order this test to diagnose disorders related to your immune system, including: Allergies Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Multiple myeloma, a type of cancer1What happens during a globulin test? Globulin tests are blood tests. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? There is no special preparation necessary for a globulin blood test. But if your health care provider has ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Low globulin levels may be a sign of liver or kidney disease, or malnutrition. High globulin levels may be a sign of: Infection Inflammatory disease Immune disorders Certain cancers, such as multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma (also called Hodgkin disease), or malignant lymphoma. Abnormal results may also be caused by certain medicines, dehydration, or other conditions. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References Clinical Info HIV.gov [Internet].

A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters help remove waste and excess fluid from the blood. A GFR test estimates how much blood passes through these filters each minute. A GFR can be measured directly, but it is a complicated test, requiring specialized providers. So GFR is most often estimated using a test called an estimated GFR or eGFR. To get an estimate, your provider will use a method known as a GFR calculator. A GFR calculator is a type of mathematical formula that estimates the rate of filtration. It does this by comparing the results of a blood test that measures creatinine, a waste product filtered by the kidneys, with other information about you. This information includes some or all of the following: The results of a blood test that measures creatinine, a waste product filtered by the kidneys Age Weight Height Gender Race The eGFR is a simple test that can provide very accurate results. Other names: estimated GFR, eGFR, calculated glomerular filtration rate, cGFR1What is it used for? A GFR test is used to help diagnose kidney disease at an early stage, when it is most treatable. GFR may also be used to monitor people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other conditions that cause kidney damage. These include diabetes and high blood pressure.1Why do I need a GFR test? Early stage kidney disease doesn’t usually cause symptoms. But you may need a GFR test if you are at higher risk of getting kidney disease. Risk factors include: Diabetes High blood pressure Family history of kidney failure Later stage kidney disease does cause symptoms. So you may need a GFR test if you have any of the following symptoms: Urinating more or less often than usual Itching Fatigue Swelling in your arms, legs, or feet Muscle cramps Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite1What happens during a GFR test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) or avoid certain foods for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your GFR results may show one of the following: Normal—you probably don’t have kidney disease Below normal—you may have kidney disease Far below normal—you may have kidney failure If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a GFR test? Although damage to your kidneys is usually permanent, you can take steps to prevent further damage. Steps may include: Blood pressure medicines Medicines to control blood sugar if you have diabetes Lifestyle changes such as getting more exercise and maintaining a healthy weight Limiting alcohol Quitting smoking If you treat kidney disease early, you may be able to prevent kidney failure. The only treatment options for kidney failure are dialysis or a kidney transplant.1References American Kidney Fund [Internet]. Rockville (MD): American Kidney Fund, Inc.; c2019.

This test measures the amount of glucagon in the blood. Glucagon is a hormone made by the pancreas. It helps control your body's level of glucose (blood sugar). Glucose is your body's main source of energy. When glucose levels drop, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream. This triggers the production of glucose. As glucose levels rise, less glucagon is released. If the pancreas doesn't release the right amount of glucagon, it can lead to serious health problems. Other names: glucagon blood test, hypoglycemia-glucagon test, glucagon-plasma1What is it used for? A glucagon test is most often used to help diagnose the following conditions: Hypoglycemia, a condition in which your glucose levels are lower than normal. Severe hypoglycemia can be deadly if it's not treated. The condition often affects people with diabetes. It can happen when diabetes medicine and/or food intake are not at the right levels. Pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. It can be acute or chronic. Acute means it appears suddenly and lasts for several days. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis are more severe and may require immediate medical attention. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition. It gets worse over time and can lead to permanent damage. Symptoms may not appear until there are complications. Glucagonoma, a rare type of tumor of the pancreas The test is sometimes used to monitor people with diabetes.1Why do I need a glucagon blood test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of hypoglycemia or a pancreatic tumor. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include: Fast or irregular heartbeat Tingling in the lips, tongue, or cheeks Anxiety Irritability Sweating Blurred vision Fatigue Pale skin Hunger Symptoms of a pancreatic tumor include: A rash on the face, stomach, or legs Diarrhea Weight loss Sores in the mouth or tongue1What happens during a glucagon blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your glucagon levels were not in the normal range, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Hypoglycemia Diabetes Acute or chronic pancreatitis Glucagonoma (pancreatic tumor) If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a glucagon blood test? A glucagon blood test and a test called a glucagon stimulation test are both often called glucagon tests. But they are not the same thing. A glucagon blood test is used to check conditions related to glucose levels. A glucagon stimulation test checks for problems with growth hormones. It is most often used for infants and children.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995–2021.

A glucose in urine test measures the amount of glucose in your urine (pee). Glucose is a type of sugar. It is the main source of energy for the cells in your body. Your blood carries glucose to your cells. Normally, urine contains very little or no glucose. But if you have too much glucose in your blood, your kidneys will get rid of some of the extra glucose through your urine. So, a high level of urine glucose may mean that your blood glucose is high, too, and that could be a sign of diabetes. If your urine glucose level is high, your health care provider will usually order a blood glucose test to help make a diagnosis. Other names: urine sugar test; urine glucose test; glucosuria test; glycosuria test1What is it used for?  A glucose in urine test may be part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and other substances in your urine. Urinalysis is used to check your general health. In the past, urine glucose testing was used to screen for or monitor diabetes. But urine glucose testing is not as accurate as blood glucose testing, so blood tests are now more commonly used to diagnose and monitor diabetes. Your provider may order a urine glucose test if blood glucose testing is difficult for you. A blood test may be difficult if your veins are too small or scarred from repeated punctures or if you have an extreme fear of needles.1Why do I need a glucose in urine test? You may have a glucose in urine test as part of your regular checkup. You may also need this test if you cannot have a blood glucose test and you have symptoms of diabetes or need to monitor diabetes. Symptoms of diabetes include: Increased thirst and urination Increased hunger Fatigue Blurred vision Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet Sores that don't heal Weight loss when you're not trying to lose weight If you are pregnant, you will likely have a glucose in urine test as part of a urinalysis to check your health. Some glucose in urine is common during pregnancy. But high levels over time could be a sign of gestational diabetes, which is diabetes that happens for the first time during pregnancy.1What happens during a glucose in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test. Your provider may ask you to monitor your urine glucose at home with a test kit. Your urine glucose home test kit will include a package of strips for testing and instructions on how to do the test. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Talk with your provider about what time of day you should test your urine to get the most accurate results.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for this test. Some medicines and supplements may affect your test results, so be sure to tell your provider about everything you're taking. But don't stop taking any medicine without talking with your provider first.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a glucose in urine test.1What do the results mean? Normally, there is little to no glucose in urine.  Too much glucose in urine may be a sign of: Diabetes, which is the most common cause of high glucose in urine Pregnancy Gestational diabetes Certain types of kidney disorders (uncommon) A urine glucose test is only a screening test. It cannot diagnose any conditions. If you have too much glucose in your urine, your provider may order blood tests for diabetes to help make a diagnosis. If you have a normal level of blood glucose with a high level of glucose in your urine, it may be a sign of an uncommon kidney condition, such as renal glycosuria or Fanconi syndrome. An increase in urine glucose doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicine, vitamin C, and eating a large meal may affect your test results. Ask your provider what your test results mean and whether you need a blood glucose test for more accurate results. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995–2022.

Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is a bacterial infection spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected person. It can also be spread from a pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth. Gonorrhea can infect both men and women. It is most common in young people, aged 15–24. Many people with gonorrhea don't know they have it. So they may spread it to others without knowing it. Men with gonorrhea may have some symptoms. But women often have no symptoms or mistake gonorrhea symptoms for a bladder or vaginal infection. A gonorrhea test looks for the presence of gonorrhea bacteria in your body. The disease can be cured with antibiotics. But if it's not treated, gonorrhea can lead to infertility and other serious health problems. In women, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus, where a baby can't survive. If not treated promptly, ectopic pregnancy can be fatal to the mother. In men, gonorrhea can cause painful urination and scarring of the urethra. The urethra is a tube that allows urine to flow from the bladder to the outside of the body and also carries semen. In men, this tube runs through the penis. Other names: GC test, gonorrhea DNA probe test, gonorrhea nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)1What is it used for? A gonorrhea test is used to find out whether you have a gonorrhea infection. It's sometimes done along with a test for chlamydia, another type of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Gonorrhea and chlamydia have similar symptoms, and the two STDs often occur together.1Why do I need a gonorrhea test? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly gonorrhea tests for all sexually active women under the age of 25. It is also recommended for sexually active older women with certain risk factors. Risk factors include: Having multiple sex partners Previous gonorrhea infection Having other STDs Having a sex partner with an STD Not using condoms consistently or correctly The CDC recommends yearly testing for men who have sex with men. Testing is not recommended for heterosexual men with no symptoms. Both men and women should be tested if they have symptoms of gonorrhea. Symptoms for women include: Vaginal discharge Pain during sex Bleeding between periods Pain when urinating Abdominal pain Symptoms for men include: Pain or tenderness in the testicles Swollen scrotum Pain when urinating White, yellow, or greenish discharge from the penis If you are pregnant, you may get a gonorrhea test early in your pregnancy. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can pass the infection to her baby during delivery. Gonorrhea can cause blindness and other serious, sometimes life-threatening, complications in infants. If you are pregnant and have gonorrhea, you can be treated with an antibiotic that is safe for you and your child.1What happens during a gonorrhea test? If you are a woman, a sample may be taken from your cervix. For this procedure, you will lie on your back on an exam table, with your knees bent. You will rest your feet in supports called stirrups. Your health care provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to open the vagina, so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a soft brush or plastic spatula to collect the sample. If you are a man, your provider may take a swab from the opening of your urethra. For both men and women, a sample may be taken from a suspected area of infection, such as the mouth or rectum. Urine tests are also used for both men and women. Some gonorrhea tests can be done with an at-home STD test kit. If your health care provider recommends at-home testing, be sure to follow all directions carefully. Your health care provider may order tests for other STDs when you get a gonorrhea test. These may include tests for chlamydia, syphilis, and/or HIV.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you are a woman, you may be asked to avoid using douches or vaginal creams for 24 hours before your test. For a urine test, both men and women should not urinate 1–2 hours before the sample is collected.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a gonorrhea test. Women may feel some mild discomfort during a swab test of the cervix. Afterward, you may have a little bleeding or other vaginal discharge.1What do the results mean? Your results will be given as negative, also called normal, or positive, also called abnormal. Negative/Normal: No gonorrhea bacteria were found. If you have certain symptoms, you may get additional STD tests to find out the cause. Positive/Abnormal: You are infected with the gonorrhea bacteria. You will be treated with antibiotics to cure the infection. Be sure to take all the required doses. Antibiotic treatment should stop the infection, but some types of gonorrhea bacteria are becoming resistant (less effective or ineffective) to certain antibiotics. If your symptoms don't improve after treatment, your health care provider may order a "susceptibility test." A susceptibility test is used to help determine which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection. Regardless of your treatment, be sure to let your sex partner know if you have tested positive for gonorrhea. That way, he or she can be tested and treated promptly. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a gonorrhea test? The best way to prevent infection with gonorrhea or other STD is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection by: Being in a long-term relationship with one partner who has tested negative for STDs Using condoms correctly every time you have sex1References ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Available from: https://www.uwhealth.org/health/topic/medicaltest/gonorrhea-test/hw4905.html Gram Stain : 1What is a Gram stain? A Gram stain is a test that checks for bacteria at the site of a suspected infection such as the throat, lungs, genitals, or in skin wounds. Gram stains may also be used to check for bacteria in certain body fluids, such as blood or urine.  There are two main categories of bacterial infections: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. The categories are diagnosed based on the how the bacteria reacts to the Gram stain. A Gram stain is colored purple. When the stain combines with bacteria in a sample, the bacteria will either stay purple or turn pink or red. If the bacteria stays purple, they are Gram-positive. If the bacteria turns pink or red, they are Gram-negative. The two categories cause different types of infections: Gram-positive infections include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), strep infections, and toxic shock. Gram-negative infections include salmonella, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and gonorrhea. Knowing whether bacteria is Gram-positive or Gram-negative can help your provider identify the type of infection you have and which antibiotics will be most effective in treating it. Other names: Gram's stain1What is it used for? A Gram stain is most often used to find out if you have a bacterial infection. If you do, the test will show if your infection is Gram-positive or Gram-negative. A Gram stain may also be used to diagnose fungal infections.1Why do I need a Gram stain? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection. Pain, fever, and fatigue are common symptoms of many bacterial infections. Other symptoms will depend on the type of infection you have and where in the body it is located.1What happens during a Gram stain? Your health care provider will need to take a sample from the site of a suspected infection or from certain body fluids, depending on what type of infection you may have. The most common types of Gram stain tests are listed below. Wound sample: A provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound. Blood test: A provider will take a sample of blood from a vein in your arm. Urine test: You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider. Throat culture: Your health care provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils. Sputum culture. Sputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva. Your health care provider will ask you to cough up sputum into a special cup, or a special swab may be used to take a sample from your nose.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a Gram stain.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to having a swab, sputum, or urine test.   There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your sample will be placed on a slide and treated with the Gram stain. A laboratory professional will examine the slide under a microscope. If no bacteria were found, it means you probably don't have a bacterial infection or there weren't enough bacteria in the sample. If bacteria were found, it will have certain qualities may provide important information about your infection: If the bacteria was colored purple, it means you likely have a Gram-positive infection. If the bacteria was colored pink or red, it means you likely have a Gram-negative infection. Your results will also include information about the shape of the bacteria in your sample. Most bacteria are either round (known as cocci) or rod-shaped (known as bacilli). The shape can provide more information about the type of infection you have. Although your results may not identify the exact type of bacteria in your sample, they can help your provider get closer to finding out what's causing your illness and how best to treat it. You may need more tests, such as a bacteria culture, to confirm what type of bacteria it is. Gram stain results may also show whether you have a fungal infection. The results may show what category of fungal infection you have: yeast or mold. But you may need more tests to find out which specific fungal infection you have. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a Gram stain? If you are diagnosed with a bacterial infection, you will probably be prescribed antibiotics. It's important to take your medicine as prescribed, even if your symptoms are mild. This can prevent your infection from getting worse and causing serious complications.1References Lab Tests Online [Internet]. Washington D.C.: American Association for Clinical Chemistry; c2001–2020.

Growth hormone (GH) tests are blood tests that check to see if your body is making a normal amount of GH. GH, also known as human growth hormone, is a substance that controls your body's growth. It also helps control metabolism, the process of how your body uses food and energy. GH is made in the pituitary gland, a small organ in the base of the brain. In children, GH plays a major role in bone growth, development of muscle mass, and height. In adults, GH affects bone and muscle health. If children or adults have too much or too little GH, it can cause health problems. GH levels in the blood fluctuate throughout the day depending on your diet and activity levels. So, a standard blood test doesn't usually provide helpful information about GH levels. Instead, GH levels are usually checked in tests that measure other substances, such as hormones and proteins, that are related to GH production. Other names: GH test, human growth hormone test, somatropin test, growth hormone stimulation test, growth hormone suppression test1What are they used for? GH tests are used to diagnose GH disorders, including: GH deficiency. In children, GH is essential for normal growth and development. A GH deficiency can cause a child to grow more slowly and be much shorter than children of the same age. In adults, GH deficiency can lead to low bone density and reduced muscle mass. Gigantism. This is a rare childhood disorder that causes the body to produce too much GH. Children with gigantism are very tall for their age and have large hands and feet. Acromegaly. This disorder, which affects adults, causes the body to produce too much growth hormone. Adults with acromegaly have thicker than normal bones and enlarged hands, feet, and facial features. The tests may also be used if other tests show a problem with the pituitary gland.1Why do I need a growth hormone test? Your provider may order a GH test if you or your child has symptoms of a GH disorder. Symptoms of GH deficiency in children include: Slowed growth rate compared with children of the same age Shorter height, arms, and legs, and lower weight than children of the same age Small penis in males Delayed puberty Adults with GH deficiency may have symptoms such as fatigue and decreased bone density and muscle mass. But GH testing isn't common for adults, as other disorders are much more likely to cause these symptoms. Symptoms of GH excess (gigantism) in children include: Excessive growth compared with children of the same age Overly large head Larger than normal hands and feet Mild to moderate obesity Symptoms of GH excess (acromegaly) in adults include: Deep, husky voice Larger than normal facial features such as lips, nose, and tongue Excessive sweating and body odor Thickening of bones  Coarse, oily skin Irregular menstrual cycles in women Erectile dysfunction in men1What happens during a growth hormone test? Your provider may order a GH stimulation or a GH suppression test, depending on whether symptoms show a possible GH deficiency (not enough GH) or a GH excess (too much GH). A GH stimulation test is used to check for a GH deficiency. During the test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. Your child (or you) will be given a medicine through an IV line that stimulates the pituitary gland to make GH. More blood samples will be taken over the course of about two hours. Each sample will be tested to see if GH levels have increased. A GH suppression test is used to check for a GH excess. During the test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You or your child will drink a solution that contains water and glucose (sugar). Two more blood samples will be taken within one to two hours after drinking the solution. The blood samples will be tested to see if GH levels have decreased.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test.1Are there any risks to this test?  There is very little risk to you or your child in having a blood test or getting an IV. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to drinking the glucose solution.1What do the results mean? If GH levels don't increase to a certain level during a GH stimulation test, it may indicate GH deficiency.  If your child is diagnosed with GH deficiency, he or she may benefit from treatment with GH supplementation. GH supplementation is an injected medicine that contains manufactured human growth hormone. When GH deficiency is diagnosed and treated early, some children can grow several inches in the first year of treatment. Others grow less and more slowly, but still benefit from treatment. If GH levels don't decrease to a certain level during a GH suppression test, it may mean your child has gigantism or you have acromegaly. Gigantism and acromegaly are most often caused by a tumor in pituitary gland, a small organ in the base of the brain that controls many functions, including growth. Treatment for the tumor may include radiation therapy, surgery, and/or medicine. If the disorders were not caused by a tumor, you or your child may need more tests. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a growth hormone test? Your provider may order other blood tests to help diagnose a GH disorder. These include: IGF-1 test. IGF-1 is a hormone that helps manage GH in the body. Unlike GH, IGF-1 levels remain stable throughout the day. So, it can be a useful way to find out if your body is making a normal amount of GH. IGBP-3 test. IGBP-3 is a protein that is the main carrier of IGF-1. This test can help diagnose a GH deficiency or GH excess.1References Beth Israel Lahey Health: Winchester Hospital [Internet].

This test measures the amount of haptoglobin in the blood. Haptoglobin is a protein made by your liver. It attaches to a certain type of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Most hemoglobin is located inside red blood cells, but small amounts circulate in the bloodstream. Haptoglobin binds to hemoglobin in the bloodstream. Together, the two proteins are known as the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex. This complex is quickly cleared from the bloodstream and removed from the body by your liver. When red blood cells are damaged, they release more hemoglobin into the bloodstream. That means more of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex will be cleared from the body. The haptoglobin may leave the body faster than the liver can make it. This causes your haptoglobin blood levels to drop. If your haptoglobin levels are too low, it may be a sign of a disorder of the red blood cells, such as anemia. Other names: hemoglobin-binding protein, HPT, Hp1What is it used for? A haptoglobin test is most often used to diagnose hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia is a disorder that happens when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. This test may also be used to see if another type of anemia or another blood disorder is causing your symptoms.1Why do I need a haptoglobin test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of anemia. These include: Fatigue Pale skin Shortness of breath Rapid heart rate Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Dark colored urine You may also need this test if you've had a blood transfusion. A haptoglobin test may be done along with another test called direct anti-globulin. The results of these tests can show if you've had a bad reaction to the transfusion.1What happens during a haptoglobin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a haptoglobin test.1Are there any risks to a haptoglobin test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show that your haptoglobin levels are lower than normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Hemolytic anemia Liver disease Reaction to a transfusion Your health care provider may order other blood tests to help make a diagnosis. These include: Reticulocyte Count Hemoglobin Test Hematocrit Test Lactate Dehydrogenase Test Blood Smear Complete Blood Count These tests may be done at the same time or after your haptoglobin test. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a haptoglobin test? High haptoglobin levels may be a sign of an inflammatory disease. Inflammatory diseases are disorders of the immune system that can cause serious health problems. But haptoglobin testing is not usually used to diagnose or monitor conditions related to high haptoglobin levels.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

Hearing tests measure how well you are able to hear. Normal hearing happens when sound waves travel into your ear, causing your eardrum to vibrate. The vibration moves the waves farther into the ear, where it triggers nerve cells to send sound information to your brain. This information is translated into the sounds you hear. Hearing loss happens when there is a problem with one or more parts of the ear, the nerves inside the ear, or the part of the brain that controls hearing. There are three main types of hearing loss: Sensorineurual (also called nerve deafness). This type of hearing loss is caused by a problem with the structure of the ear and/or with the nerves that control hearing. It may be present at birth or show up late in life. Sensorineural hearing loss is usually permanent. This type of hearing loss ranges from mild (the inability to hear certain sounds) to profound (the inability to hear any sounds). Conductive. This type of hearing loss is caused by a blockage of sound transmission into the ear. It can occur at any age, but it's most common in infants and young children and is often caused by ear infections or fluid in the ears. Conductive hearing loss is usually mild, temporary, and treatable. Mixed, a combination of both sensorineural and conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss is common in older adults. About one-third of adults over the age of 65 have some hearing loss, most often the sensorineural type. If you are diagnosed with hearing loss, there are steps you can take that may help treat or manage the condition. Other names: audiometry, audiography, audiogram, sound test1What are they used for? Hearing tests are used to find out whether or not you have a hearing problem and, if so, how serious it is.1Why do I need a hearing test? You may need a hearing test if you have symptoms of hearing loss. These include: Trouble understanding what other people are saying, especially in a noisy environment Needing to ask people to repeat themselves Trouble hearing high-pitched sounds Needing to turn up the volume on the TV or music player A ringing sound in your ears1What happens during a hearing test? Your hearing test may be done by a primary health care provider or one of the following types of providers: An audiologist, a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and managing hearing loss An otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor specializing in treating diseases and conditions of the ears, nose, and throat. There are several types of hearing tests. Most tests check for your response to tones or words delivered at different pitches, volumes, and/or noise environments. These are called sound tests. Common sound tests include: Acoustic Reflex Measures, also called middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR), test how well the ear responds to loud sounds. In normal hearing, a tiny muscle inside the ear tightens when you hear loud noises. This is called the acoustic reflex. It happens without you knowing it. During the test: The audiologist or other provider will place a soft rubber tip inside the ear. A series of loud sounds will be sent through the tips and recorded onto a machine. The machine will show when or if the sound has triggered a reflex. If hearing loss is bad, the sound may have to be very loud to trigger a reflex, or it may not trigger the reflex at all. Pure-tone test, also known as audiometry. During this test: You will put on headphones. A series of tones will be sent to your headphones. The audiologist or other provider will change the pitch and loudness of the tones at different points during the test. At some points, the tones may be barely audible. The provider will ask you to respond whenever you hear the tones. Your response may be to raise your hand or press a button. The test helps find the quietest sounds you can hear at different pitches. Tuning fork tests. A tuning fork is a two-pronged metal device that makes a tone when it vibrates. During the test: The audiologist or other provider will place the tuning fork behind your ear or on top of your head. The provider will hit the fork so that it makes a tone. You'll be asked to tell the provider whenever you hear the tone at different volumes, or if you heard the sound in your left ear, right ear, or both equally. Depending on where the fork is placed and how you respond, the test can show if there is hearing loss in one or both ears. It can also show which type of hearing loss you have (conductive or sensorineural). Speech and word recognition tests can show how well you can hear spoken language. During the test: You will put on headphones. The audiologist will talk to you through your headphones, and ask you to repeat a series of simple words, spoken at different volumes. The provider will record the softest speech you are able to hear. Some of the testing may be done in a noisy environment, because many people with hearing loss have trouble understanding speech in loud places. Another type test, called tympanometry, checks for how well your eardrum moves. During a tympanometry test: The audiologist or other provider will place a small device inside the ear canal. The device will push air into the ear, making the eardrum move back and forth. A machine records the movement on graphs called tympanograms. The test helps find out if there is an ear infection or other problems such as fluid or wax buildup, or a hole or tear in the eardrum.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a hearing test? You don't need any special preparations for a hearing test.1Are there any risks to hearing tests? There is no risk to having a hearing test.1What do the results mean? Your results may show if you have a hearing loss, and whether the hearing loss is sensorineural or conductive. If you are diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss, your results may show that the hearing loss is: Mild: you can't hear certain sounds, such as tones that are too high or too low. Moderate: you can't hear many sounds, such as speech in a noisy environment. Severe: you can't hear most sounds. Profound: you can't hear any sounds. Treatment and management of sensorineural hearing loss will depend on serious it is. If you are diagnosed with conductive hearing loss, your provider may recommend medicine or surgery, depending on the cause of the loss. If you have questions about the results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about hearing tests? Even mild hearing loss can make it difficult to understand normal speech. Because of this, many older adults will avoid social situations, leading to isolation and depression. Treating hearing loss can help prevent these problems. While hearing loss in older adults is usually permanent, there are ways to manage the condition. Treatment options include: Hearing aids. A hearing aid is a device that's worn either behind or inside the ear. A hearing aid amplifies (makes louder) sound. Some hearing aids have more advanced functions. Your audiologist can recommend the best option for you. Cochlear implants. This is a device that's implanted surgically in the ear. It's usually used in people with more severe hearing loss and who don't get much benefit from using a hearing aid. Cochlear implants send sound directly to the hearing nerve. Surgery. Some types of hearing loss can be treated with surgery. These include problems with the eardrum or in the tiny bones inside the ear.1References American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) [Internet].

Although hearing loss can occur at any age, hearing problems in infancy and early childhood can have serious consequences. That's because normal hearing is essential for language development in babies and toddlers. Even a temporary hearing loss can make it harder for a child to understand spoken language and learn to speak. Normal hearing happens when sound waves travel into your ear, causing your eardrum to vibrate. The vibration moves the waves farther into the ear, where it triggers nerve cells to send sound information to your brain. This information is translated into the sounds you hear.

These tests are used to find out if your child has hearing loss and, if so, how serious it is.1Why does my child need a hearing test? Routine hearing tests are recommended for most babies and children. Newborns are usually given hearing tests before they leave the hospital. If your baby doesn't pass this hearing test, it doesn't always mean serious hearing loss. But your baby should be retested within three months. Most children should get their hearing checked at regular health checkups. These checkups may include a physical exam of the ear that checks for excess wax, fluid, or signs of infection. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends more thorough hearing tests (see below for types of tests) at ages 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. Tests should be done more often if your child has symptoms of hearing loss. Symptoms of hearing loss in a baby include: Not jumping or being startled in reaction to loud noises Not reacting to a parent's voice by 3 months of age Not turning his or her eyes or head toward a sound by 6 months of age Not imitating sounds or saying a few simple words by 12 months of age Symptoms of hearing loss in a toddler include: Delayed speech or speech that is hard to understand. Most young children can say a few words, like "mama" or "dada," by 15 months of age. Not responding when called by name Not paying attention Symptoms of hearing loss in older children and teens include: Trouble understanding what other people are saying, especially in a noisy environment Trouble hearing high-pitched sounds Needing to turn up the volume on the TV or music player A ringing sound in the ears1What happens during a hearing test? Initial hearing tests are often done during regular checkups. If there is hearing loss, your child may be tested and treated by one of the following providers: An audiologist, a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and managing hearing loss An otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor specializing in treating diseases and conditions of the ears, nose, and throat. There are several types of hearing tests. The type of tests given depends on age and symptoms. For infants and young children, testing involves using sensors (which look like small stickers) or probes to measure hearing. They don't require a verbal response. Older children may be given sound tests. Sound tests check for response to tones or words delivered at different pitches, volumes, and/or noise environments. Auditory brainstorm (ABR) test. This checks for sensorineural hearing loss. It measures how the brain responds to sound. It is most often used to test infants, including newborns. During this test: The audiologist or other provider will place electrodes on the scalp and behind each ear. The electrodes are connected to a computer. Tiny earphones will be placed inside the ears. Clicks and tones will be sent to the earphones. The electrodes measure the brain's response to the sounds and will display the results on the computer. Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) test. This test is used for infants and young children. During the test: The audiologist or other provider will place a small probe that looks like an earphone inside the ear canal. Sound will be sent to the probe. The probe records and measures the inner ear's response to the sounds. The test can find hearing loss, but can't tell the difference between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Tympanometry tests how well your eardrum moves. During the test: The audiologist or other provider will place a small device inside the ear canal. The device will push air into the ear, making the eardrum move back and forth. A machine records the movement on graphs called tympanograms. The test helps find out if there is an ear infection or other problems such as fluid or wax buildup, or a hole or tear in the eardrum. This test requires your child to sit very still, so it's not usually used on infants or young children. The following are other types of sound tests: Acoustic Reflex Measures also called middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR), test how well the ear responds to loud sounds. In normal hearing, a tiny muscle inside the ear tightens when you hear loud noises. This is called the acoustic reflex. It happens without you knowing it. During the test: The audiologist or other provider will place a soft rubber tip inside the ear. A series of loud sounds will be sent through the tips and recorded onto a machine. The machine will show when or if the sound has triggered a reflex. If hearing loss is bad, the sound may have to be very loud to trigger a reflex, or it may not trigger the reflex at all. Pure-tone test, also known as audiometry. During this test: Your child will put on headphones. A series of tones will be sent to the headphones. The audiologist or other provider will change the pitch and loudness of the tones at different points during the test. At some points, the tones may be barely audible. The provider will ask your child to respond whenever they hear the tones. The response may be to raise a hand or press a button. The test helps find the quietest sounds your child can hear at different pitches. Tuning fork tests. A tuning fork is a two-pronged metal device that makes a tone when it vibrates. During the test: The audiologist or other provider will place the tuning fork behind the ear or on top of the head. The provider will hit the fork so that it makes a tone. Your child will be asked to tell the provider whenever you hear the tone at different volumes, or if they heard the sound in the left ear, right ear, or both equally. The test can show if there is hearing loss in one or both ears. It can also show which type of hearing loss your child has (conductive or sensorineural). Speech and word recognition  can show how well your child can hear spoken language. During the test: Your child will put on headphones. The audiologist will talk through the headphones, and ask your child to repeat a series of simple words, spoken at different volumes. The provider will record the softest speech your child is able to hear. Some of the testing may be done in a noisy environment, because many people with hearing loss have trouble understanding speech in loud places. These tests are done on children old enough to talk and understand language.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a hearing test? Your child doesn't need any special preparations for a hearing test.1Are there any risks to hearing tests? There is no risk to having a hearing test.1What do the results mean? Your results may show if your child has hearing loss, and whether the hearing loss is conductive or sensorineural. If your child is diagnosed with conductive hearing loss, your provider may recommend medicine or surgery, depending on the cause of the loss. If your child is diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss, your results may show that the hearing loss is: Mild: your child can't hear certain sounds, such as tones that are too high or too low. Moderate: your child can't hear many sounds, such as speech in a noisy environment. Severe: your child can't hear most sounds. Profound: your child can't hear any sounds. Treatment and management of sensorineural hearing loss will depend on age and how serious it is. If you have questions about the results, talk to your child's health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about hearing tests? There are many ways to manage hearing loss. Even if the hearing loss is permanent, there are ways to manage your condition. Treatment options include: Hearing aids. A hearing aid is a device that's worn either behind or inside the ear. A hearing aid amplifies (makes louder) sound. Some hearing aids have more advanced functions. Your audiologist can recommend the best option for you. Cochlear implants. This is a device that's implanted surgically in the ear. It's usually used in people with more severe hearing loss and who don't get much benefit from using a hearing aid. Cochlear implants send sound directly to the hearing nerve. Surgery. Some types of hearing loss can be treated with surgery. These include problems with the eardrum or in the tiny bones inside the ear. In addition, you may want to: Work with health care providers who can help you and your child communicate. These may include speech therapists and/or specialists who provide training in sign language, lip reading, or other types of language approaches.

Heart disease is a general term that refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type is coronary artery disease, which can lead to a heart attack. Other types include stroke and heart failure. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. A heart disease risk assessment, also known as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment, is a type of screening tool that measures your risk of heart disease or CVD. Heart disease is a type of CVD, which is a group of diseases of the heart and blood vessels. A heart disease risk assessment includes a series of questions about certain risk factors, including age, family history, and lifestyle habits such as diet and exercise. It then calculates your risk of developing heart disease in the future. Even if you feel healthy now, the assessment can show if you need to take steps to prevent or reduce your chances of developing heart disease later. Other names: cardiovascular disease assessment, CVD risk factors assessment, heart disease risk calculator, ASCVD risk calculator1What is it used for? A heart disease risk assessment is used to check how likely it is that someone will develop heart disease in the next 10 years.1Why do I need a heart disease risk assessment? The assessment can be helpful for most  adults aged 40 or older. If you are younger than 40, you may need an assessment if you have a family history of heart disease or certain CVD risk factors.1What happens during a heart disease risk assessment? There are different types of heart disease risk assessment. They each include general questions about your health and possible risk factors for heart disease. The most common heart disease risk assessments are known as: ACC/AHA Cardiovascular Risk Calculator ASCVD Risk Calculator. ASCVD stands for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is a condition where plaque (fatty deposits) build up in the walls of the arteries. It can block blood flow and may lead to heart attack or stroke. Reynolds Risk Score Framingham General CVD Risk Profile The test can be done by yourself online or by a health care provider. Your assessment may include questions about some or all of the following: Age Gender Height and weight Blood pressure Cholesterol levels Whether you smoke or have smoked in the past Whether you have diabetes Activity level Diet1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a heart disease risk assessment.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk in taking a questionnaire.1What do the results mean? Heart disease risk assessment results are calculated based on data from clinical studies on heart disease. Your answers will be compared with patient data from these studies. Your results will be given as a percentage. A lower percentage means you have less risk of developing heart disease within the next 10 years. A higher percentage means you have a greater risk. If your percentage is high, your doctor may recommend steps to lower your risk. Some risk factors, such as age and family history, can't be controlled. But you can take steps to lower your risk for factors you can control. These may include eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and quitting smoking. These steps can benefit all adults. If you are at a high risk of heart disease, your provider may also recommend medicines such as: Statins, which lower cholesterol Blood pressure medicines, also called antihypertensives Blood thinners, such as aspirin, which can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. Many people with coronary artery disease (CAD) are treated with aspirin. But aspirin therapy has some risks and is only recommended for people with certain risk factors for heart disease. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a heart disease risk assessment? Depending on the results of your assessment, your provider may order additional tests including: Cholesterol levels, a test that measures cholesterol levels in your blood Electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical signals in your heart Stress test, a test that measures how well your heart handles physical activity1References American College of Cardiology [Internet].

A heavy metal blood test is a group of tests that measures the levels of possibly harmful metals in your blood. Heavy metals are found naturally in the environment. They're also found in certain medicines, supplements, and foods. And chemicals used in industry and farming may contain heavy metals, which can end up in the air, soil, and water. Heavy metals get into your body in different ways. You might breathe them in, eat them, or absorb them through your skin. Because heavy metals are just about everywhere, it's normal to have some in your body. But if too much heavy metal gets into your body, it can cause heavy metal poisoning. Heavy metal poisoning can lead to organ damage, behavioral changes, or difficulties with thinking and memory. The symptoms of heavy metal poisoning depend on the type of metal, how much is in your body, and your age. Children and unborn babies have the highest risk for serious, long-term health problems from heavy metals. Poisoning from heavy metals can happen slowly over time or suddenly if you are exposed to a large amount of heavy metal all at once. The most commonly tested heavy metals are: Lead Mercury Arsenic Cadmium Chromium Other metals that may be tested include aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, platinum, selenium, silicon, silver, and thallium. You may have a heavy metal blood test for one type of metal, or you may have a test for a group of metals, called a "heavy metal panel." Other names: heavy metals panel, toxic metals, heavy metal toxicity test1What is it used for? Heavy metal testing is used to find out if you have been exposed to certain metals, and how much of the metal is in your system.1Why do I need a heavy metal blood test? Your health care provider may order a heavy metal blood test if you had a possible exposure to heavy metal or if you have symptoms of heavy metal poisoning. If your job involves heavy metals, your employer may require regular testing to help monitor workplace safety. Symptoms of heavy metal poisoning depend on the type of metal and how much exposure you had. Your symptoms may include: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal (belly) pain Diarrhea Tingling in the hands and feet Shortness of breath Chills Muscle weakness Memory loss or changes in behavior Arrhythmia (problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Children under the age of 6 may need to be tested for lead poisoning if they have a risk of exposure to lead, even when they don't have symptoms. That's because very low levels of lead can damage a child's developing brain and cause long-term growth and learning problems. Children have a risk of lead exposure if they spend time in homes built before 1978 when lead-based paint was still used. These homes may have lead in household dust from old chipping or peeling paint. Lead from old paint and other old sources may also remain in the soil, especially in older neighborhoods of some cities. Young children tend to be exposed when they touch surfaces or soil with lead and put their hands in their mouths. Your child's provider may recommend lead testing based on your child's possible exposure to lead and where you live. Some state and local governments require all children to be tested for lead.1What happens during a heavy metal blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Some fish and shellfish contain high levels of mercury, so you should avoid eating seafood for 48 hours before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean?  Higher than normal levels of a heavy metal in your blood may mean that you have heavy metal poisoning, but not always. Even if you don't have symptoms, you may still need to avoid all exposure to that metal. Depending on the heavy metal and your condition, you may also need treatment to help your body get rid of the heavy metal as quickly as possible. In certain cases, your provider may recommend chelation therapy. For this therapy, you'll take medicine by mouth or have an injection (shot) of a medicine that helps remove the metals from your body through urine (pee). In certain cases, chelation medicine is given through an IV (intravenous) line. Chelation therapy can have serious side effects, so the risks and benefits must be carefully considered. Normal or low levels of heavy metal in your blood usually mean that you don't have heavy metal poisoning. But some heavy metals leave your bloodstream quickly and are stored in your tissues. So, if you have symptoms, your provider will likely order more tests to check for heavy metals in samples of your urine, hair, skin, or fingernail clipping. Talk with your provider to learn what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References American Academy of Pediatrics [Internet].

Pylori) Tests : 1What are helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) tests? Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria that infects the digestive system. Many people with H. pylori will never have symptoms of infection. But for others, the bacteria can cause a variety of digestive disorders. These include gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), peptic ulcers (sores in the stomach, small intestine, or esophagus), and certain types of stomach cancer. There are different ways to test for an H. pylori infection. They include blood, stool, and breath tests. If you are having digestive symptoms, testing and treatment may help prevent serious complications. Other names: H. pylori stool antigen, H. pylori breath tests, urea breath test, rapid urease test (RUT) for H. pylori, H. pylori culture1What are they used for? H. pylori tests are most often used to: Look for H. pylori bacteria in the digestive tract Find out if your digestive symptoms are caused by an H. pylori infection Find out if treatment for an H. pylori infection has worked1Why do I need an H. pylori test? You may need testing if you have symptoms of a digestive disorder. Since gastritis and ulcers both inflame the lining of the stomach, they share many of the same symptoms. They include: Abdominal pain Bloating Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Weight loss An ulcer is a more serious condition than gastritis, and symptoms are often more severe. Treating gastritis in early stages may help prevent the development of an ulcer or other complications.1What happens during H. pylori testing? There are different ways to test for H. pylori. Your health care provider may order one or more of the following types of tests. Blood test Checks for antibodies (infection-fighting cells) to H. pylori Test procedure:


A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.
After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Breath test, also known as a urea breath test Checks for infection by measuring certain substances in your breath Test procedure:


You will provide a sample of your breath by breathing into a collection bag.
After that, you will swallow a pill or liquid containing a harmless radioactive material.
You will provide another sample of your breath.
Your provider will compare the two samples. If the second sample has higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, it is a sign of an H. pylori infection.

You will provide another sample of your breath. Your provider will compare the two samples. If the second sample has higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, it is a sign of an H. pylori infection. Stool tests.Your provider may order a stool antigen or a stool culture test. A stool antigen test looks for antigens to H. pylori in your stool. Antigens are substances that trigger an immune response. A stool culture test looks for H. pylori bacteria in the stool. Samples for both types of stool tests are collected in the same way. Sample collection usually includes the following steps:


Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves.
Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab.
If collecting a sample from a baby, line the baby's diaper with plastic wrap.
Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample.
Seal and label the container.
Remove the gloves, and wash your hands.
Return the container to your health care provider.

Remove the gloves, and wash your hands. Return the container to your health care provider. Endoscopy. If other tests did not provide enough information for a diagnosis, your provider may order a procedure called an endoscopy. An endoscopy allows your provider to look at your esophagus (the tube that links your mouth and stomach), the lining of your stomach, and part of your small intestine. During the procedure: You will lie down on an operating table on your back or side. You will be given medicine to help you relax and prevent you from feeling pain during the procedure. Your provider will insert a thin tube, called an endoscope, into your mouth and throat. The endoscope has a light and camera on it. This allows the provider to get a good view of your internal organs. Your provider may take a biopsy (removal of a small sample of tissue) to examine after the procedure. After the procedure, you will be observed for an hour or two while the medicine wears off. You may be drowsy for a while, so plan to have someone drive you home.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for testing? You don't need any special preparation for an H. pylori blood test. For breath, stool, and endoscopy tests, you may need to stop taking certain medicines for as long as two weeks to a month before testing. Be sure to talk with your health care provider about all medicines you are currently taking. For an endoscopy, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for about 12 hours before the procedure.1Are there any risks to testing? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no known risk to having breath or stool tests. During an endoscopy, you may feel some discomfort when the endoscope is inserted, but serious complications are rare. There is a very small risk of getting a tear in your intestine. If you had a biopsy, there is a small risk of bleeding at the site. Bleeding usually stops without treatment.1What do the results mean? If your results were negative, it means you probably don't have an H. pylori infection. Your provider may order more tests to find out the cause of your symptoms. If your results were positive, it means you have an H. pylori infection. H. pylori infections are treatable. Your health care provider will probably prescribe a combination of antibiotics and other medicines to treat the infection and relieve pain. The medicine plan can be complicated, but it's important to take all the medicines as prescribed, even if your symptoms go away. If any H. pylori bacteria remain in your system, your condition can worsen. Gastritis caused by H. pylori can lead to a peptic ulcer and sometimes stomach cancer. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about H. pylori testing? After you've been treated with antibiotics, your health care provider may order repeat tests to make sure all the H. pylori bacteria is gone.1References American Gastroenterological Association [Internet].

A hematocrit test is a blood test that measures how much of your blood is made up of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. The other parts of your blood include white blood cells (to help fight infection), platelets (to help make blood clots to stop bleeding), and a liquid called plasma. Hematocrit levels that are too high or too low can be a sign of a blood disorder, dehydration, or other medical conditions that affect your blood. Other names: HCT, packed cell volume, PCV, Crit;; H and H (Hemoglobin and Hematocrit)1What is it used for? A hematocrit test is often part of a complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a common blood test that measures the different parts of your blood. It is used to check your general health. It may also be used to help diagnose blood disorders, including anemia, a condition in which you don't have enough red blood cells, and polycythemia, an uncommon disorder in which you have too many red blood cells and your blood becomes too thick.1Why do I need a hematocrit test? Your health care provider may order a hematocrit test as part of your regular checkup or to monitor your health if you are being treated for cancer or have an ongoing health condition. Your provider may also order this test if you have symptoms of a red blood cell disorder, such as anemia or polycythemia: Symptoms of anemia (too few red blood cells) may include: Shortness of breath Weakness or fatigue Headache Dizziness Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Symptoms of polycythemia (too many red blood cells) may include: Headache Feeling light-headed or dizzy Shortness of breath Weakness or fatigue Skin symptoms such as itching after a shower or bath, burning, or a red face Heavy sweating, especially during sleep Blurred or double vision and blind spots Bleeding gums and heavy bleeding from small cuts1What happens during a hematocrit test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a hematocrit test. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a hematocrit test or other type of blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your hematocrit test results are reported as a number. That number is the percentage of your blood that's made of red blood cells. For example, if your hematocrit test result is 42, it means that 42% of your blood is red blood cells and the rest is white blood cells, platelets, and blood plasma. A hematocrit level that's lower than normal may be a sign that: Your body doesn't have enough red blood cells (anemia). There are many types of anemia that can be caused by different medical conditions. Your body is making too many white blood cells, which may be caused by:

Bone marrow disease
Certain cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or cancers that spread to the bone marrow from other parts of the body

 Bone marrow disease Certain cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or cancers that spread to the bone marrow from other parts of the body A hematocrit level that's higher than normal may be a sign that: Your body is making too many red blood cells, which may be caused by:

Lung disease
Congenital heart disease
Heart failure
Polycythemia

 Lung disease Congenital heart disease Heart failure Polycythemia Your blood plasma level is too low, which may be caused by:

Dehydration, the most common cause of a high hematocrit
Shock

 Dehydration, the most common cause of a high hematocrit Shock If your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Living at high altitudes where there's less oxygen in the air may cause a high hematocrit. That's because your body responds to low oxygen levels by making more red blood cells so that you get the oxygen you need. Pregnancy can cause a low hematocrit. That's because the body has more fluid than normal during pregnancy, which decreases the percentage that's made of red blood cells. To learn what your test results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a hematocrit test? Normal hematocrit levels will be different depending on your sex, age, and the altitude where you live. Ask your provider what hematocrit level is normal for you.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet]. Washington D.C.: American Society of Hematology; c2022.

A hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) test is a blood test that shows what your average blood sugar (glucose) level was over the past two to three months. Glucose is a type of sugar in your blood that comes from the foods you eat. Your cells use glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps glucose get into your cells. If you have diabetes your body doesn't make enough insulin, or your cells don't use it well. As a result, glucose can't get into your cells, so your blood sugar levels increase. Glucose in your blood sticks to hemoglobin, a protein in your red blood cells. As your blood glucose levels increase, more of your hemoglobin will be coated with glucose. An A1C test measures the percentage of your red blood cells that have glucose-coated hemoglobin. An A1C test can show your average glucose level for the past three months because: Glucose sticks to hemoglobin for as long as the red blood cells are alive. Red blood cells live about three months. High A1C levels are a sign of high blood glucose from diabetes. Diabetes can cause serious health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage. But with treatment and lifestyle changes, you can control your blood glucose levels. Other names: HbA1C, A1C, glycohemoglobin, glycated hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin1What is it used for? An A1C test may be used to screen for or diagnose: Type 2 diabetes. With type 2 diabetes your blood glucose gets too high because your body doesn't make enough insulin to move blood sugar from your bloodstream into your cells, or because your cells stop responding to insulin. Prediabetes. Prediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to diagnosed as diabetes. Lifestyle changes, such as healthy eating and exercise, may help delay or prevent prediabetes from becoming type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes or prediabetes, an A1C test can help monitor your condition and check how well you've been able to control your blood sugar levels.1Why do I need an HbA1C test? The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends A1C testing for diabetes and prediabetes if: You are over age 45.

If your results are normal, you should repeat the test every 3 years.
If your results show you have prediabetes, you will usually need to be tested every 1 to 2 years. Ask your provider how often to get tested and what you can do to reduce your risk of developing diabetes.
If your results show you have diabetes, you should get an A1C test at least twice a year to monitor your condition and treatment.

 If your results are normal, you should repeat the test every 3 years. If your results show you have prediabetes, you will usually need to be tested every 1 to 2 years. Ask your provider how often to get tested and what you can do to reduce your risk of developing diabetes. If your results show you have diabetes, you should get an A1C test at least twice a year to monitor your condition and treatment. You are under 45 and are more likely to develop diabetes because you:

Have prediabetes.
Are overweight or have obesity.
Have a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes.
Have high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels.
Have heart disease or have had a stroke.
Are physically active less than 3 times a week.
Have had gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) or given birth to a baby over 9 pounds.
Are African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, or an Alaska Native person. Some Pacific Islander and Asian American people also have a higher risk of developing diabetes.
Have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A1C results tell you what percentage of your hemoglobin is coated with glucose.  The percent ranges are just a guide to what is normal. What's normal for you depends on your health, age, and other factors. Ask your provider what A1C percentage is healthy for you. To diagnose diabetes or prediabetes, the percentages commonly used are: Normal: A1C below 5.7% Prediabetes: A1C between 5.7% and 6.4% Diabetes: A1C of 6.5% or higher Providers often use more than one test to diagnose diabetes. So, if your test result was higher than normal, you may have another A1C test or a different type of diabetes test, usually either a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If your A1C test was done to monitor your diabetes, talk with your provider about what your test results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an HbA1C test? The A1C test is not used to diagnose gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes. Also, if you have a condition that affects your red blood cells, such as anemia or another type of blood disorder, an A1C test may not be accurate for diagnosing diabetes. Kidney failure and liver disease can also affect A1C results. In these cases, your provider may recommend different tests to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet].

Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. There are several different types of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that measures the different types of hemoglobin in the blood. It also looks for abnormal types of hemoglobin. Normal types of hemoglobin include: Hemoglobin (Hgb) A, the most common type of hemoglobin in healthy adults Hemoglobin (Hgb) F, fetal hemoglobin. This type of hemoglobin is found in unborn babies and newborns. HgbF is replaced by HgbA shortly after birth. If levels of HgbA or HgbF are too high or too low, it can indicate certain types of anemia. Abnormal types of hemoglobin include: Hemoglobin (Hgb) S. This type of hemoglobin is found in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that causes the body to make stiff, sickle-shaped red blood cells. Healthy red blood cells are flexible so they can move easily through blood vessels. Sickle cells can get stuck in the blood vessels, causing severe and chronic pain, infections, and other complications. Hemoglobin (Hgb) C. This type of hemoglobin does not carry oxygen well. It can cause a mild form of anemia. Hemoglobin (Hgb) E. This type of hemoglobin is mostly found in people of Southeast Asian descent. People with HgbE usually have no symptoms or mild symptoms of anemia. A hemoglobin electrophoresis test applies an electric current to a blood sample. This separates normal and abnormal types of hemoglobin. Each type of hemoglobin can then be measured individually. Other names: Hb electrophoresis, hemoglobin evaluation, hemoglobinopathy evaluation, hemoglobin fractionation, Hb ELP, sickle cell screen1What is it used for? Hemoglobin electrophoresis measures hemoglobin levels and looks for abnormal types of hemoglobin. It's most often used to help diagnose anemia, sickle cell disease, and other hemoglobin disorders.1Why do I need hemoglobin electrophoresis? You may need testing if you have symptoms of a hemoglobin disorder. These include: Fatigue Pale skin Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Severe pain (sickle cell disease) Growth problems (in children) If you've just had a baby, your newborn will be tested as part of a newborn screening. Newborn screening is a group of tests given to most American babies shortly after birth. The screening checks for a variety of conditions. Many of these conditions can be treated if found early. You may also want testing if you are at risk for having a child with sickle cell disease or another inherited hemoglobin disorder. Risk factors include: Family history Ethnic background

In the United States, most people with sickle cell disease are of African ancestry.
Thalassemia, another inherited hemoglobin disorder, is most common among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent.

 In the United States, most people with sickle cell disease are of African ancestry. Thalassemia, another inherited hemoglobin disorder, is most common among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent.1What happens during hemoglobin electrophoresis? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. To test a newborn, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a hemoglobin electrophoresis test.1Are there any risks to hemoglobin electrophoresis? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will show the types of hemoglobin found and the levels of each. Hemoglobin levels that are too high or too low may mean: Thalassemia, a condition that affects the production of hemoglobin. Symptoms range from mild to severe. Sickle cell trait. In this condition, you have one sickle cell gene and one normal gene. Most people with sickle cell trait do not have health problems. Sickle cell disease Hemoglobin C disease, a condition that causes a mild form of anemia and sometimes an enlarged spleen and joint pain Hemoglobin S-C disease, a condition that causes a mild or moderate form of sickle cell disease Your results may also show whether a specific disorder is mild, moderate, or severe. There are several options for treating thalassemia and other hemoglobin disorders. Until recently, treatment options for sickle cell disease were limited. But now, promising new therapies have become available. If you or your child was diagnosed with a sickle cell disease or other hemoglobin disorder, talk to your provider about treatment options. Hemoglobin electrophoresis test results are often compared with other tests, including a complete blood count and a blood smear. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about hemoglobin electrophoresis? If you are at risk of having a child with an inherited hemoglobin disorder, you may want to speak to a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. He or she can help you understand the disorder and your risk of passing it along to your child.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

A hemoglobin test measures the levels of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. If your hemoglobin levels are abnormal, it may be a sign that you have a blood disorder. Other names: Hb, Hgb1What is it used for? A hemoglobin test is often used to check for anemia, a condition in which your body has fewer red blood cells than normal. If you have anemia, the cells in your body don't get all the oxygen they need. Hemoglobin tests are measured as part of a complete blood count (CBC).1Why do I need a hemoglobin test? Your health care provider may order the test as part of a routine exam, or if you have: Symptoms of anemia, which include weakness, dizziness, and cold hands and feet A family history of thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or other inherited blood disorder A diet low in iron and other minerals A long-term infection Excessive blood loss from an injury or surgical procedure1What happens during a hemoglobin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparation for a hemoglobin test. If your health care provider has ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. After the test, some people experience mild pain, dizziness, or bruising. These symptoms usually go away quickly.1What do the results mean? There are many reasons your hemoglobin levels may not be in the normal range. Low hemoglobin levels may be a sign of: Different types of anemia Thalassemia Iron deficiency Liver disease Cancer and other diseases High hemoglobin levels may be a sign of: Lung disease Heart disease Polycythemia vera, a disorder in which your body makes too many red blood cells. It can cause headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath. If any of your levels are abnormal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Diet, activity level, medicines, a menstrual period, and other factors can affect the results.  You may also have higher than normal hemoglobin levels if you live in a high altitude area. Talk with your provider to learn what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a hemoglobin test? Some forms of anemia are mild, while other types of anemia can be serious and even life threatening if not treated. If you are diagnosed with anemia, be sure to talk to your health care provider to find out the best treatment plan for you.1References Aruch D, Mascarenhas J.

A hepatitis panel is a group of blood tests that checks whether you have a viral hepatitis infection now or had one in the past. It may also show that you are immune to certain types of hepatitis because you had a vaccination. Hepatitis is a type of liver disease that causes inflammation of the liver. The most common cause of hepatitis is a group of viruses called hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. A hepatitis panel is a blood test that checks to see if you have a hepatitis infection caused by one of these viruses. Hepatitis viruses spread in different ways. They affect your health in different ways, too: Hepatitis A is commonly spread by eating or drinking food or water that has been contaminated with even the tiniest traces of stool (poop) from an infected person. This may happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands after using the bathroom.
Most people recover from hepatitis A on their own without any lasting liver damage.

This may happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands after using the bathroom. Most people recover from hepatitis A on their own without any lasting liver damage. Hepatitis B is spread by contact with body fluids from an infected person, such as blood, semen, and saliva (spit). The contact usually happens from having sex with an person who has the infection or by sharing needles or other items used for injecting drugs.
Most people recover from a hepatitis B infection on their own with no lasting liver damage. But some people may have a chronic (long-term) infection, which can lead to chronic liver disease and liver cancer. Anti-viral medicine may help chronic cases.

Hepatitis C is spread by contact with blood from an infected person. This usually happens through sharing needles or other items used for injecting drugs.
Most people who get hepatitis C will have a chronic infection. In most cases, medicine can cure hepatitis C. Without treatment, chronic hepatitis C may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.

Most people who get hepatitis C will have a chronic infection. In most cases, medicine can cure hepatitis C. Without treatment, chronic hepatitis C may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. A hepatitis panel includes tests for hepatitis antigens and antibodies: Hepatitis antigens are substances in the hepatitis virus that trigger your immune system to fight the virus. Hepatitis antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to help fight a hepatitis infection. Hepatitis antigens and antibodies can be found in your blood even if you don't have symptoms of an infection. Other names: acute hepatitis panel, viral hepatitis panel, hepatitis screening panel1What is it used for? A hepatitis panel is used to find out if you have an active hepatitis A or B infection now or if you had one in the past. It is also used to find out if you've ever been infected with hepatitis C. But the test can't tell the difference between a past hepatitis C infection and an infection you have now. If a hepatitis panel shows that you may have hepatitis, you'll usually need more tests to learn about your condition.1Why do I need a hepatitis panel? You may need a hepatitis panel if you were exposed to someone who has viral hepatitis or if you have symptoms of hepatitis. Hepatitis doesn't always cause symptoms, but when it does, they may include: Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Dark-colored urine Pale or clay-colored stool (poop) Abdominal (belly) pain Nausea and vomiting Joint pain Diarrhea (with hepatitis A only) Your health care provider may order a hepatitis panel if you had an abnormal result on a liver panel or if you have a high risk of having a viral hepatitis infection. Your risk may be high if you: Have been in close contact with someone infected with hepatitis Share or have shared needles to use drugs Have a sexually transmitted disease (STD) Are a man who has sex with men (MSM) Are on long-term dialysis Have a job that may expose you to hepatitis, such as health care, daycare, or public safety Had an organ transplant or a blood transfusion before 1992 Have traveled to areas with a lack of safe water and poor sanitation1What happens during a hepatitis panel? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. At-home testing kits are available for hepatitis B and C. Usually the test kit will include a sharp device, (a lancet) to prick your finger so you can collect a drop of blood to send to a lab for testing. For more information on at-home testing for hepatitis, talk to your provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a hepatitis panel.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Labs report hepatitis panel results in different ways: A negative or normal result means you probably don't have a hepatitis infection. A positive or abnormal result may mean you have a hepatitis infection now or had an infection in the past. For hepatitis A and B, your test results will say whether you have a current or past infection, or if you have immunity because you had a vaccination. If your test shows that you have signs of hepatitis C, you will need another test to find out if you are infected now, or if you had an infection in the past. There is no vaccination for hepatitis C. You may need more tests to confirm a diagnosis and to see how hepatitis has affected your liver. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a hepatitis panel? There are vaccines for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Talk with your health provider if you or your children should get vaccinated.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=19580 HER2 (Breast Cancer) Testing : 1What is HER2 breast cancer testing? HER2 stands for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. It is a gene that makes a protein found on the surface of all breast cells. It is involved in normal cell growth. Genes are the basic units of heredity, passed down from your mother and father. In certain cancers, especially breast cancer, the HER2 gene mutates (changes) and makes extra copies of the gene. When this happens, the HER2 gene makes too much HER2 protein, causing cells to divide and grow too fast. Cancers with high levels of the HER2 protein are known as HER2-positive. Cancers with low levels of the protein are known as HER2-negative. About 20 percent of breast cancers are HER2-positive. HER2 positive cancers tend to grow and spread faster than other types of breast cancer. But treatments that specifically target HER2-positive breast cancer can be very effective. HER2 testing looks at a sample of tumor tissue to find out whether you have HER2-positive breast cancer. Other names: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, ERBB2 amplification, HER2 overexpression, HER2/neu tests1What is it used for? HER2 testing is mostly used to find out whether cancer is HER2-positive. It is also sometimes used to see if cancer is responding to treatment or if cancer has returned after treatment.1Why do I need HER2 breast cancer testing? If you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, you may need this test to find out if your cancer is HER2-positive or HER2-negative. If you are already being treated for HER2-positive breast cancer, you may need this test to: Find out if your treatment is working. Normal levels of HER2 may mean you are responding to treatment. High levels may mean the treatment is not working. Find out if cancer has come back after treatment.1What happens during a HER2 breast cancer test? Most HER2 testing involves taking a sample of tumor tissue in a procedure called a biopsy. There are three main types of biopsy procedures: Fine needle aspiration biopsy, which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid Core needle biopsy, which uses a larger needle to remove a sample Surgical biopsy, which removes a sample in a minor, outpatient procedure Fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies usually include the following steps: You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table. A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Once the area is numb, the provider will insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of tissue or fluid. You may feel a little pressure when the sample is withdrawn. Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops. Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site. In a surgical biopsy, a surgeon will make a small cut in your skin to remove all or part of a breast lump. A surgical biopsy is sometimes done if the lump can't be reached with a needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include the following steps. You will lie on an operating table. An IV (intravenous line) may be placed in your arm or hand. You may be given medicine, called a sedative, to help you relax. You will be given local or general anesthesia so you won't feel pain during the procedure.For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area.For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine so you will be unconscious during the procedure. For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area. For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine so you will be unconscious during the procedure. Once the biopsy area is numb or you are unconscious, the surgeon will make a small cut into the breast and remove part or all of a lump. Some tissue around the lump may also be removed. The cut in your skin will be closed with stitches or adhesive strips. The type of biopsy you have will depend on different factors, including the size and location of the tumor. HER2 can also be measured in a blood test, but blood testing for HER2 has not been proven to be useful for most patients. So it is not usually recommended. After your tissue sample has been taken, it will be tested in one of two ways: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, which measures the HER2 protein on the surface of the cells Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, which looks for extra copies of the HER2 gene Both types of tests can tell whether you have HER2-positive cancer.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You won't need any special preparations if you are getting local anesthesia (numbing of the biopsy site). If you are getting general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. Your surgeon will give you more specific instructions. Also, if you are getting a sedative or general anesthesia, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home. You may be groggy and confused after you wake up from the procedure.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. Sometimes the site gets infected. If that happens, you will be treated with antibiotics. A surgical biopsy may cause some additional pain and discomfort. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe medicine to help you feel better. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If HER2 protein levels are higher than normal or extra copies of the HER2 gene are found, it probably means you have HER2-positive cancer. If your results show normal amounts of HER2 protein or the normal number HER2 genes, you probably have HER2-negative cancer. If your results were not clearly positive or negative, you will probably get retested, either using a different tumor sample or using a different testing method. Most often, IHC (testing for the HER2 protein) is done first, followed by FISH (testing for extra copies of the gene). IHC testing is less expensive and provides faster results than FISH. But most breast specialists think FISH testing is more accurate. Treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer can substantially shrink cancerous tumors, with very few side effects. These treatments are not effective in HER2-negative cancers. If you are being treated for HER2-positive cancer, normal results may mean you are responding to treatment. Results that show higher than normal amounts may mean your treatment is not working, or that cancer has come back after treatment. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about HER2 breast cancer testing? While it's much more common in women, breast cancer, including HER2-positive breast cancer, can also affect men. If a man has been diagnosed with breast cancer, HER2 testing may be recommended. In addition, both men and women may need HER2 testing if they have been diagnosed with certain cancers of the stomach and esophagus. These cancers sometimes have high levels of the HER2 protein and may respond well to HER2-positive cancer treatments.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Herpes is a skin infection caused by the herpes simplex virus, known as HSV. HSV causes painful blisters or sores in different parts of the body. There are two main types of HSV: HSV-1, which usually causes blisters or cold sores around the mouth (oral herpes) HSV-2, which usually causes blisters or sores in the genital area (genital herpes) Herpes is spread through direct contact with sores. HSV-2 is usually spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Sometimes herpes can be spread even if there are no visible sores. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are recurring infections. That means after your first outbreak of sores clears up, you may get another outbreak in the future. But the severity and number of outbreaks tend to lessen over time. Although oral and genital herpes can be uncomfortable, the viruses usually don't cause any major health problems. In rare cases, HSV can infect other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. These infections can be very serious. Herpes can also be dangerous to a newborn baby. A mother with herpes can pass the infection to her baby during delivery. A herpes infection can be life threatening to a baby. An HSV test looks for the presence of the virus in your body. While there is no cure for herpes, there are medicines that can help manage the condition. Other names: herpes culture, herpes simplex viral culture, HSV-1 antibodies, HSV-2 antibodies, HSV DNA1What is it used for? An HSV test may be used to: Find out whether sores on the mouth or genitals are caused by HSV Diagnose an HSV infection in a pregnant woman Find out if a newborn is infected with HSV1Why do I need an HSV test? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend HSV testing for people without symptoms of HSV. But you may need an HSV test if: You have symptoms of herpes, such as blisters or sores on the genitals or other part of the body Your sex partner has herpes You are pregnant and you or your partner has had a previous herpes infection or symptoms of genital herpes. If you test positive for HSV, your baby may need testing as well. HSV-2 may increase your risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You may need a test if you have certain risk factors for STDs. You may be at higher risk if you: Have multiple sex partners Are a man who has sex with men Have a partner with HIV and/or another STD In rare cases, HSV can cause encephalitis or meningitis, life-threatening infections of the brain and spinal cord. You may need an HSV test if you have symptoms of a brain or spinal cord disorder. These include: Fever Stiff neck Confusion Severe headache Sensitivity to light1What happens during an HSV test? HSV testing is usually done as a swab test, blood test, or lumbar puncture. The type of test you get will depend on your symptoms and health history. For a swab test, a health care provider will use a swab to collect fluid and cells from a herpes sore. For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. A lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, is only done if your provider thinks you may have an infection of the brain or spinal cord. During a spinal tap:You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.

This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a swab test or a blood test. For a lumbar puncture, you may be asked to empty your bladder and bowels before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a swab test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. If you had a lumbar puncture, you may have pain or tenderness in your back where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache after the procedure.1What do the results mean? Your HSV test results will be given as negative, also called normal, or positive, also called abnormal. Negative/Normal. The herpes virus was not found. You may still have an HSV infection if your results were normal. It may mean the sample didn't have enough of the virus to be detected. If you still have symptoms of herpes, you may need to get tested again. Positive/Abnormal. HSV was found in your sample. It may mean you have an active infection (you currently have sores), or were infected in the past (you have no sores). If you tested positive for HSV, talk to your health care provider. While there is no cure for herpes, it hardly ever causes serious health problems. Some people may only have one outbreak of sores their whole lives, while others break out more often. If you want to reduce the severity and number of your outbreaks, your provider may prescribe a medicine that can help. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an HSV test? The best way to prevent genital herpes or another STD is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection by Being in a long-term relationship with one partner who has tested negative for STDs Using condoms correctly every time you have sex If you've been diagnosed with genital herpes, condom use can reduce your risk of spreading the infection to others.1References Allina Health [Internet].

An HIV test checks a sample of your blood to see whether you are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). HIV is a virus that destroys certain cells in your immune system. These cells protect your body against diseases from germs, such as bacteria and viruses, and fungi. If you lose too many immune cells, your body will have trouble fighting off infections and other diseases. HIV is spread through contact with blood and other body fluids from a person who has an HIV infection. This usually happens during sex or when sharing needles or other items used to inject drugs. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). AIDS is the final, most serious stage of an HIV infection. Without treatment, HIV gradually destroys your immune system, which leads to AIDS. With AIDS, your body has trouble fighting off infections from germs that usually don't cause problems in healthy people. These are called opportunistic infections, and they can become life-threatening. AIDS increases your risk of developing certain cancers, too. Most people with HIV don't have AIDS. If you have HIV and you take HIV medicines as prescribed, you may never get AIDS. Getting tested for HIV helps catch the virus early so you can start treatment, stay healthy, and avoid spreading HIV. If you think you were exposed to HIV, talk with your health care provider right away about emergency treatment, called PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis). PEP may prevent an HIV infection if it is started within three days after a possible exposure. The sooner you start, the better. You will need to have HIV tests during and after taking PEP. There are three main types of HIV tests. They are all very accurate, but no test can find HIV in your body immediately after you're infected. That's because it can take weeks until the signs of HIV in your body increase enough to show up on a test. The time between infection and when a test can find HIV depends on your body's response to HIV and the type of test you have: HIV antibody tests look for HIV antibodies in your blood, saliva (spit), or urine (pee). HIV antibodies are disease-fighting proteins that your immune system makes when you have an HIV infection. Some people make antibodies faster than others. An antibody test may find HIV antibodies as early as 23 days after infection, but it may take as long as 90 days before your body makes enough antibodies to show up on this test.

Antibody tests can be done in different ways:


Lab tests use a blood sample taken from a vein. In general, lab tests can find antibodies sooner after infection than other HIV antibody tests. Test results are usually ready a few days after your blood sample is taken.
Rapid tests use blood from your finger, saliva, or urine. They provide results in about 30 minutes.
At-home tests include rapid self-test kits with everything you need to collect and test a sample of saliva on your own. With mail-in tests, you collect a drop of blood from your finger to send to a lab for testing.

With mail-in tests, you collect a drop of blood from your finger to send to a lab for testing. HIV antibody/antigen tests are the most commonly used HIV tests. They look for HIV antibodies and antigens in your blood. An antigen is the part of the HIV virus that triggers your immune system to fight the infection. After an HIV exposure, antigens will show up in your blood sooner than antibodies:


Lab tests that use a blood sample from a vein can find an HIV infection as soon as 18 to 45 days after you were infected.
Rapid tests use a drop of blood from your finger. This test can find HIV infections starting between 18 days to 90 days after you were infected.
At-home tests, or mail-in tests, allow you to collect blood from your finger at home to send to a lab for testing. Like rapid tests, these tests can start finding HIV 18 to 90 days after infection.

At-home tests, or mail-in tests, allow you to collect blood from your finger at home to send to a lab for testing. Like rapid tests, these tests can start finding HIV 18 to 90 days after infection. NAT tests (nucleic acid tests) look for HIV in a sample of your blood taken from a vein and tested in a lab. These tests may also be called "viral load tests." They can usually find an HIV infection as soon as 10 to 33 days after infection. But they are mostly used for monitoring HIV treatment and not for routine screening, because they are expensive. Ask your provider about having a NAT test as soon as possible if you:


May have been exposed to HIV and have symptoms, such as:


Flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, aches
Extreme fatigue

 Flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, aches Extreme fatigue Swollen lymph nodes (in your neck, groin, or armpit) Rash Sores in your mouth Know you were exposed to HIV or were very likely exposed Other names: HIV antibody/antigen tests, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody and antigen evaluation, HIV test, human immunodeficiency virus antibody test, type 1, HIV p24 antigen test1What is it used for? An HIV screening test is used to find out if you have been infected with HIV. It may be done as a routine test or after a possible exposure to find out if you were infected with HIV. If HIV is found early, you can take medicines to protect your health so you don't get AIDS. And medicines can help you avoid spreading HIV to others.1Why do I need an HIV test? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. You may need to be tested more than once if you have a higher risk for infection. If your last HIV test was more than a year ago, you should get tested as soon as possible if you have: Had vaginal or anal sex with someone who has HIV (HIV positive) or whose HIV status you don't know Injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug items with other people Exchanged sex for money or drugs Had a sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as syphilis Had sex with anyone who has done anything listed above If you regularly do any of the things on the above list, you should be tested for HIV at least once every year. Certain people, including men who have sex with men (MSM), may benefit from being tested more often, depending on their risk. Ask your provider how often you should be tested. If you are pregnant, your doctor may order an HIV test. That's because HIV can be passed to the baby during pregnancy and birth, and through breast milk. There are medicines you can take during pregnancy and delivery that greatly reduce your risk of spreading HIV your baby.1What happens during an HIV test? There are many places to get tested for HIV, including at your doctor's office, health clinics, testing programs in your community, and at home. If you go somewhere for your test, a staff person or counselor will explain what type of sample will be taken and how. If you do a test at home, be sure to follow all the instructions that come with your test kit. For blood from a vein, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For blood from a finger, a health care professional will use a special tool (lancet) to prick your finger and collect a sample of blood. If you are collecting your own blood sample to send to a lab, follow the instructions that come with your collection kit. For a saliva sample, a health care professional will wipe a special swab along your gums. If you are doing an at-home test, you will do this yourself according to the instructions.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an HIV test. If you are getting tested in a health clinic or community program, a counselor may talk with you about your risk for HIV. So, you may want to write down any questions you have ahead of time.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having any HIV screening test. If you have blood taken from a vein, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A negative test result means that no signs of an HIV infection were found in your sample. But that doesn't always mean that you don't have HIV. You could have an HIV infection, but it's too soon for the test to tell and you made need another test later. Your provider or an HIV counselor can explain your test result and let you know if you need another test. In general, if you have a negative result  on a rapid test or an at-home test and a possible HIV exposure that was: 90 days ago or longer, you can be confident that you don't have HIV Less than 90 days ago, you will likely need another test later to check for HIV again A positive test result means that signs of an HIV infection were found in your sample. You will need a follow-up test to confirm an HIV diagnosis unless you had a NAT test. If you used an at-home test, see your provider for follow-up testing. If you had your test at medical office or community program, the testing site will arrange your follow-up test. If your follow-up test is also positive, it means you have HIV. It's important to start medicines called antiretroviral therapy (ART) right away, even if you're still healthy. ART can't cure HIV, but it may lower the amount of virus in your blood so much that a test can't find it. If you're living with HIV, it's important to see your provider regularly for tests to check how your treatment is working. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about HIV screening? HIV testing can be anonymous. That means you do not have to give your name when you take an HIV test. Instead, you'll receive a number. To get your test results, you'll give the number instead of your name.1References AIDSinfo [Internet].

An HIV viral load is a blood test that measures the amount of HIV in a sample of your blood. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The test looks for genetic material from the virus in your blood. These tests are called molecular tests or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT or NAT). There are several types of NAAT tests. A PCR test is one type of NAAT that may be used to find HIV. HIV is a virus that destroys certain cells in your immune system. These cells protect your body against diseases from germs, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. If you lose too many immune cells, your body will have trouble fighting off infections and other diseases. You can get HIV from contact with the blood of a person who has an HIV infection. This usually happens through sex or sharing needles or other equipment used to inject drugs. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).  AIDS is the final, most serious stage of an HIV infection. Without treatment, the amount of HIV in your body can increase. It can gradually destroy your immune system and become AIDS. With AIDS, your body has trouble fighting off infections from germs that usually don't cause problems in healthy people. These are called opportunistic infections, and they can become life-threatening.  AIDS increases your risk of developing certain cancers, too. Most people with HIV don't have AIDS. If you have HIV, you can take HIV medicines that protect your immune system and help prevent you from getting AIDS. Medicines that treat HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART can't get rid of HIV completely, so you'll need to take medicines for the rest of your life. But ART can control HIV and help you live a longer, healthier life. Having regular HIV viral load tests is an important part of making sure your HIV medicines are keeping your viral load low, so you stay healthy. Other names: nucleic acid testing, NAT, nucleic acid amplification test, NAAT, HIV PCR, RNA Test, HIV quantification1What is it used for? An HIV viral load test is mainly used after you're diagnosed with HIV to: Guide decisions about your treatment Check how well your HIV medicines are working Watch for any changes in your HIV infection HIV viral load testing is also used to test newborn babies when they are born to a person who has HIV. That's because HIV can be passed to a baby during pregnancy, childbirth, and through breast milk. In certain cases, an HIV viral load test may be used to diagnose HIV. Usually, HIV screening tests are used first. That's because HIV viral load tests are expensive. But viral load tests can find HIV sooner after an infection than screening tests. So, your health care provider may order this test if your risk of having HIV is very high.1Why do I need an HIV viral load? A viral load test is needed to guide treatment decisions. If you have HIV, you'll probably start taking HIV medicines soon after your diagnosis. But first, you'll need a viral load test to find out how much virus is in your blood. This information helps your provider choose the right medicines for you. Your first test result will be compared with later test results to see if the medicines are working. A viral load test is needed to see how well treatment is working and to monitor your HIV infection. The goal of HIV treatment is to reduce the amount of virus in your blood until there's too little to show up on a test. You'll need to have regular viral load tests to see whether your viral load is dropping enough. HIV viral load tests are usually done: Before you start taking medicine About two to eight weeks after starting or changing HIV medicines Every three to six months to monitor your infection when your treatment is working well Your provider may order an HIV viral load test to diagnose HIV if: You recently had a high-risk exposure to HIV. High-risk exposures include:


Having vaginal or anal sex with someone who has HIV or whose HIV status you don't know
Sharing needles, syringes, or other items used to inject drugs with other people
Exchanging sex for money or drugs
Having a sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as syphilis
Having sex with anyone who has done anything listed above

 Having vaginal or anal sex with someone who has HIV or whose HIV status you don't know Sharing needles, syringes, or other items used to inject drugs with other people Exchanging sex for money or drugs Having a sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as syphilis Having sex with anyone who has done anything listed above You had a recent possible exposure to HIV, and you have early symptoms of HIV infection. The early stage of HIV doesn't always cause symptoms. When it does, they may include:


Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, aches
Extreme fatigue
Swollen lymph nodes (in your neck, groin, or armpit)
Rash
Sores in your mouth

 Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, aches Extreme fatigue Swollen lymph nodes (in your neck, groin, or armpit) Rash Sores in your mouth If you think you were exposed to HIV, talk with your provider right away about getting tested. You may also be able to have emergency treatment to prevent HIV infection within the first 3 days after a possible exposure.1What happens during an HIV viral load? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an HIV viral load. But if you are getting this test to find out if you are infected with HIV, you should talk with a counselor before or after your test so you can better understand the results and your treatment options.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you have an HIV viral load test because you have HIV: A negative or undetectable viral load means that you have so little HIV in your blood that the test can't find it. This means that your HIV medicines are working well to protect your immune system, and you are unlikely to spread HIV through sex. It does not mean you're cured. You must continue to take your medicines as prescribed to keep your HIV in control. A low viral load means your medicine is stopping the virus from growing and your infection is unlikely to get worse. A high viral load means the virus is growing and your treatment is not working well.  The higher the viral load, the more risk you have for infections and diseases related to a weak immune system. It may also mean you have a higher risk for developing AIDS. If your results show a high viral load, your provider will probably change your medicines. If you had an HIV viral load test to diagnose whether you have HIV: A normal or negative result means that no HIV was found in your blood, and you are probably not infected with HIV. A result that shows any amount of virus in your blood means you have an HIV infection. Your provider will likely order other tests, including a CD4 count, to see how much HIV has damaged your immune system. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an HIV viral load? If you are living with HIV, you will have regular viral load tests to monitor your infection and treatment. It's best to have the same type of test done at the same lab if possible. That's because labs have different ways of measuring HIV viral load. Your provider needs to compare your test results over time to see if your viral load is going up or down, and different tests from different labs can be difficult to compare.1References AIDSinfo [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/tu6396 Homocysteine Test : 1What is a homocysteine test? A homocysteine test measures the amount of homocysteine in a sample of your blood. Homocysteine is an amino acid. Amino acids are molecules that your body uses to make proteins. Normally, your homocysteine levels are low. That's because your body uses vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid (also called folate or vitamin B9) to quickly break down homocysteine and change it into other substances that your body needs. High levels of homocysteine in your blood may be a sign that this process isn't working properly or that you're lacking certain B vitamins. High levels of homocysteine can damage the inside of your arteries and increase your risk of forming blood clots. This may increase your risk for heart attack, stroke, and other heart diseases and blood vessel disorders. Other names: total homocysteine, plasma total homocysteine1What is it used for? A homocysteine test may be used to: Find out if you're lacking vitamin B6, B12, or folic acid. These vitamins break down homocysteine. So if you don't have enough of them, your homocysteine levels will increase. A homocysteine test may be done with a blood test to measure your vitamin B levels. Help diagnose homocystinuria. Homocystinuria is a rare, genetic disease that prevents your body from using a certain amino acid to make important proteins. Symptoms usually show up in the first year of life, but they may not appear until childhood or later. Common symptoms include problems with eyesight, blood clots, and weak bones. In the U.S., most newborns have a routine screening test to check for homocystinuria. Better understand your risk for heart attack or stroke if you already have an increased risk. Your health care provider may order a homocysteine test if you have been diagnosed with heart or blood vessel disease or if you have conditions that increase your risk for heart and blood vessel disease, such as:


High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Diabetes

 High blood pressure High cholesterol Diabetes Medical experts don't recommend routine homocysteine testing to screen for heart disease risk in everyone. That's because researchers aren't sure how much homocysteine levels affect heart and blood vessel diseases. And so far, studies have shown that lowering homocysteine levels doesn't reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke.1Why do I need a homocysteine test? You may need this test if you have symptoms that suggest you lack vitamin B12 or folic acid. The symptoms may be very mild to severe and may include: Dizziness Fatigue and/or weakness Headache Heart palpitations (racing or pounding heart) Changes in the color of your skin or fingernails Sores on your tongue or in your mouth Tingling or numbness in your hands, feet, arms, and/or legs Your provider may order this test if you have a high risk for low levels of vitamin B12 or folic acid because you: Have malnutrition. Are an older adult. Older people often can't absorb enough vitamin B12 from food. Have alcohol use disorder or a drug addiction. Your provider may recommend this test if you: Have had a heart attack or stroke Have one or more conditions that increase your risk for heart attack or stroke, such as high LDL "bad" cholesterol or high blood pressure1What happens during a homocysteine test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 8–12 hours before a homocysteine test. Some medicines and supplements may affect your test results. So, tell your provider about all medicines and supplements you take, especially vitamin B.  But never stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A high homocysteine level may be a sign that: You are not getting enough vitamin B12 or folic acid in your diet. You (or your child) have homocystinuria. You will probably need more testing to rule out or confirm a diagnosis of homocystinuria. You may have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, or other blood vessel disorders. Higher than normal homocysteine levels may also happen with other conditions, such as osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, or Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. If your homocysteine levels are high, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your results may be affected by: Your age. Homocysteine levels may get higher as you get older. Your sex. Males usually have higher homocysteine levels than females, but levels in females increase after menopause. Smoking If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a homocysteine blood test? If you have high homocysteine levels, your provider may suggest that you make changes in the foods you eat. Eating a balanced diet can help you get the right amount of vitamins. If you're considering taking vitamin supplements, talk with your provider first. Research has not shown that reducing homocysteine levels can reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke.1References Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing [Internet].

Medical tests are procedures that are used to diagnose, screen for, or monitor various diseases and conditions. While many people sometimes feel nervous or uncomfortable about testing, it doesn't usually cause serious problems or symptoms. Medical test anxiety can be serious. It can become a type of phobia. A phobia is an anxiety disorder that causes an intense, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Phobias can also cause physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and trembling.1What are the different types of medical tests? The most common types of medical tests are: Tests of body fluids. Your body fluids include blood, urine, sweat, and saliva. Testing involves getting a sample of the fluid. Imaging tests. These tests look at the inside of your body. Imaging tests include x-rays, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Another type of imaging test is endoscopy. Endoscopy uses a thin, lighted tube with a camera that is inserted into the body. It provides images of internal organs and other systems. Biopsy. This is a test that takes a small sample of tissue for testing. It is used to check for cancer and certain other conditions. Measurement of body functions. These tests check the activity of different organs. Testing may include checking the electrical activity of the heart or brain or measuring the function of the lungs. Genetic testing. These tests check cells from the skin, bone marrow, or other areas. They are most often used to diagnose genetic diseases or find out if you are at risk for getting a genetic disorder. These procedures can provide important information about your health. Most tests have little or no risk. But people with medical test anxiety may be so afraid of testing that they avoid them altogether. And this can actually put their health at risk.1What are the types of medical test anxiety? The most common types of medical anxieties (phobias) are: Trypanophobia, the fear of needles. Many people have some fear of needles, but people with trypanophobia have an excessive fear of injections or needles. This fear may stop them from getting needed tests or treatment. It can be especially dangerous to people with chronic medical conditions that need frequent testing or treatment. Iatrophobia, the fear of doctors and medical tests. People with iatrophobia may avoid seeing health care providers for routine care or when they have symptoms of illness. But some minor illnesses can turn serious or even deadly if left untreated. Claustrophobia, the fear of enclosed spaces. Claustrophobia can affect people in many different ways. You may experience claustrophobia if you are getting an MRI. During an MRI, you are placed inside an enclosed, tube-shaped scanning machine. The space in the scanner is narrow and small.1How do I cope with medical test anxiety? Fortunately, there are some relaxation techniques that may reduce your medical test anxiety, including: Deep breathing. Take three slow breaths. Count to three for each one, then repeat. Slow down if you start to feel lightheaded. Counting. Count to 10, slowly and silently. Imagery. Close your eyes and picture an image or a place that makes you feel happy. Muscle relaxation. Concentrate on making your muscles feel relaxed and loose. Talking. Chat with someone in the room. It may help distract you. If you have trypanophobia, iatrophobia, or claustrophobia, the following tips may help reduce your specific type of anxiety. For trypanophobia, fear of needles: If you don't have to limit or avoid fluids beforehand, drink lots of water the day before and morning of a blood test. This puts more fluid in your veins and may make it easier to draw blood. Ask your provider if you can get a topical anesthetic to numb the skin. If the sight of a needle bothers you, close your eyes or turn away during the test. If you have diabetes and need to get regular insulin injections, you might be able to use a  needle-free alternative, such as a jet injector. A jet injector delivers insulin using a high-pressure jet of mist, instead of a needle. For iatrophobia, the fear of doctors and medical tests: Bring a friend or family member to your appointment for support. Bring a book, magazine, or something else to distract you while you wait for your appointment. For moderate or severe iatrophobia, you may want to consider seeking help from a mental health professional. If you feel comfortable talking with your provider, ask about medicines that could help reduce your anxiety. To avoid claustrophobia during an MRI: Ask your health care provider for a mild sedative prior to the exam. Ask your provider if you can get tested in an open MRI scanner instead of a traditional MRI. Open MRI scanners are larger and have an open side. It may make you feel less claustrophobic. The images produced may not be as good as those done in a traditional MRI, but it still may be helpful in making a diagnosis. Avoiding medical tests can be harmful to your health. If you suffer from any type of medical anxiety, you should talk with your health care provider or a mental health professional.11111111References Beth Israel Lahey Health: Winchester Hospital [Internet].

A laboratory (lab) test is a procedure in which a health care provider takes a sample of your blood, urine, other body fluid, or body tissue to get information about your health. Lab tests are often used to help diagnose or screen for a specific disease or condition. Screening helps diagnose diseases before symptoms occur. Other tests are used to monitor a disease or see if treatment is effective. Lab tests may also be done to provide more general information about your organs and body systems. For any type of lab test, you should prepare for it by: Following all the instructions given to you by your health care provider Telling your provider or lab professional if you didn't follow these instructions exactly. It's important to be honest. Even a minor change from the instructions can have a big effect on your results. For example, some medicines raise or lower blood sugar levels. Taking them too close to a blood sugar test could affect your results. Telling your provider about any medicines, vitamins, or supplements that you are taking Taking these steps can help ensure your results will be accurate and reliable.1Will I need to take other steps to prepare for my lab test? For many lab tests, you don't need to do anything other than answer questions from your provider and/or lab professional. But for others, you may need do some specific preparations before the test. One of the most common lab test preparations is fasting. Fasting means you should not eat or drink anything except water for up to several hours or overnight before your test. This is done because nutrients and ingredients in food are absorbed in the bloodstream. This can affect certain blood test results. The length of fasting can vary. So if you do need to fast, make sure you ask your provider how long you should do it. Other common test preparations include: Avoiding specific foods and drinks such as cooked meats, herbal tea, or alcohol Making sure not to overeat the day before a test Not smoking Avoiding specific behaviors such as strenuous exercise or sexual activity Avoiding certain medicines and/or supplements. Be sure to talk to your provider about what you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and supplements. For some blood tests, you may be asked to drink extra water to help keep more fluid in your veins. You may also be asked to drink water 15 to 20 minutes before certain urine tests.1What types of lab tests require special preparation? Some of the most common lab tests that require fasting include: Blood Glucose Test Cholesterol Levels Test Triglycerides Test Calcitonin Test Some of the most common lab tests that require other special preparations include: Creatinine Test, which may require fasting or avoiding cooked meats Cortisol Test. For this test, you may need to rest for a bit before your sample is taken. You may also have to avoid eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth for a certain time period before your test. Fecal Occult Blood Test. For this test, you may need to avoid certain foods or medicines. 5-HIAA Test. For this test, you may be asked to avoid a variety of specific foods. These include avocados, bananas, pineapples, walnuts, and eggplants. Pap Smear. A woman may be instructed not to douche, use tampons, or have sex for 24 to 48 hours before this test.1Is there anything else I should know about preparing for a lab test? If you have questions or concerns about test preparations, talk to your health care provider. Be sure you understand your preparation instructions before the day of your test. 111111References Accu Reference Medical Lab [Internet]. Linden (NJ): Accu Reference Medical Labs; c2015.

A laboratory (lab) test is a procedure in which a health care provider takes a sample of blood, urine, or other body fluid, or body tissue. The tests can provide important information about your child's health. They may be used to help diagnose diseases and conditions, monitor treatments for a disease, or check the health of organs and body systems. But lab tests can be scary, especially for children. Fortunately, children don't need to be tested as often as adults. But if your child does need testing, you can take steps to help him or her feel less scared and anxious. Preparing in advance may also help keep your child calm and less likely to resist the procedure.1How do I prepare my child for a lab test? Here are some simple steps that may make your child feel more at ease before and during a lab test. Explain what will happen. Tell your child why the test is needed and how the sample will be collected. Use language and terms based on your child's age. Assure your child you will be with them or nearby the whole time.  Be honest, but reassuring. Don't tell your child the test won't hurt; it may actually be painful. Instead, say that the test may hurt or pinch a bit, but the pain will go away quickly. Practice the test at home. Younger children can practice doing the test on a stuffed animal or doll. Practice deep breathing and other comforting activities with your child.These may include thinking happy thoughts and counting slowly from one to ten. Schedule the test at the right time. Try to schedule the test for a time when your child is less likely to be tired or hungry. If your child is getting a blood test, eating beforehand will lessen the chance of lightheadedness. But if your child needs a test that requires fasting (not eating or drinking), it's best to schedule the test for first thing in the morning. You should also bring a snack for afterward. Offer plenty of water. If the test doesn't require limiting or avoiding fluids, encourage your child to drink lots of water the day before and the morning of the test. For a blood test, it can make it easier to draw blood, because it puts more fluid in the veins. For a urine test, it can make it easier to urinate when the sample is needed. Offer a distraction. Bring along a favorite toy, game, or book to help distract your child before and during the test. Provide physical comfort. If the provider says it's OK, hold your child's hand or provide other physical contact during the test. If your baby needs a test, comfort him or her with gentle physical contact and use a calm, quiet voice. Hold your baby during the test if you are allowed. If not, stand where your baby can see your face. Plan a reward for afterward.Offer your child a treat or make a plan to do something fun together after the test. Thinking about a reward may help distract your child and encourage cooperation during the procedure. Specific preparations and tips will depend on your child's age and personality, as well as the type of test being performed.1What happens to my child during a lab test? Common lab tests for children include blood tests, urine tests, swab tests, and throat cultures.  Blood tests are used to test for many different diseases and conditions. During a blood test, a sample will be taken from a vein in the arm, a fingertip, or a heel. If done on a vein, a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. A fingertip blood test is done by pricking your child's fingertip. Heel stick tests are used for newborn screenings, a test given shortly after birth to almost every baby born in the United States. Newborn screenings are used to help diagnose a variety of serious health conditions. During a heel stick test, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. During a blood test, encourage your child to look at you, rather than at the person drawing the blood. You should also provide physical comfort and distraction. Urine tests are done to check for different diseases and for infections of the urinary tract. During a urine test, your child will need to provide a urine sample in a special cup. Unless your child has an infection or a rash, a urine test is not painful. But it can be stressful. The following tips may help. Talk to your child's provider to find out if a "clean catch" method will be needed. For a clean catch urine sample, your child will need to:


Clean their genital area with a cleansing pad
Start to urinate into the toilet
Move the collection container under the urine stream
Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts
Finish urinating into the toilet

 Clean their genital area with a cleansing pad Start to urinate into the toilet Move the collection container under the urine stream Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts Finish urinating into the toilet If a clean catch sample is needed, practice at home. Ask your child to let out a bit of urine in the toilet, stop the flow, and start again. Encourage your child to drink water before the appointment, but not go to the bathroom. This may make it easier to urinate when it's time to collect the sample. Turn on the tap. The sound of running water can help your child begin to urinate. Swab tests help diagnose different types of respiratory infections. During a swab test, a health care provider will: Gently insert a cotton-tipped swab inside your child's nostril. For some swab tests, a provider may need to insert the swab deeper, until the reaches the uppermost part of the nose and throat, known as the nasopharynx. Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10-15 seconds. Remove the swab and insert into the other nostril. Swab the second nostril using the same technique. Swab tests may tickle the throat or cause your child to cough. A swab of the nasopharynx may be uncomfortable and cause a gag reflex when the swab touches the throat. Let your child know beforehand that gagging may happen, but it will be over quickly. It may also help to tell your child that the swab is similar to the cotton swabs you have at home. Throat cultures are done to check for bacterial infections of the throat, including strep throat. During a throat culture: Your child will be asked to tilt their head back and open their mouth as wide as possible. Your child's provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your child's tongue. The provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils. A throat swab isn't painful, but like some swab tests, it can cause gagging. Let your child know what to expect and that any discomfort shouldn't last very long.111Is there anything else I should know about preparing my child for a lab test? If you have questions or concerns about testing or if your child has special needs, talk to your child's health care provider. You can work together to discuss the best way to prepare and comfort your child throughout the testing process.1References AACC [Internet].

A laboratory (lab) test is a procedure in which a health care provider takes a sample of your blood, urine, other bodily fluid, or body tissue to get information about your health. Some lab tests are used to help diagnose, screen, or monitor a specific disease or condition. Other tests provide more general information about your organs and body systems. Lab tests play an important role in your health care. But they don't provide a complete picture of your health. Your provider will likely include a physical exam, health history, and other tests and procedures to help guide diagnosis and treatment decisions.1Why do I need a lab test? Lab tests are used in many different ways. Your health care provider may order one or more lab tests to: Diagnose or rule out a specific disease or conditionAn HPV test is an example of this type of test. It can show you whether or not you have an HPV infection An HPV test is an example of this type of test. It can show you whether or not you have an HPV infection Screen for a disease. A screening test can show if you are at a higher risk for getting a specific disease. It can also find out if you have a disease, even if you have no symptoms.A Pap test is a type of screening test for cervical cancer A Pap test is a type of screening test for cervical cancer Monitor a disease and/or treatment. If you've already been diagnosed with a disease, lab tests can show if your condition is getting better or worse. It can also show if your treatment is working.A blood glucose test is a type of test that is used to monitor diabetes and diabetes treatment. It is also sometimes used to diagnose the disease. A blood glucose test is a type of test that is used to monitor diabetes and diabetes treatment. It is also sometimes used to diagnose the disease. Check your overall health. Lab tests are often included in a routine checkup. Your provider may order tests of various organs and systems to see if there have been changes in your health over time. Testing can help find health problems before symptoms appear.A complete blood count is a type of routine test that measures different substances in your blood. It can give your health care provider important information about your overall health and risk for certain diseases. A complete blood count is a type of routine test that measures different substances in your blood. It can give your health care provider important information about your overall health and risk for certain diseases.1What do my results mean? Lab results are often shown as a set of numbers known as a reference range. A reference range may also be called "normal values." You may see something like this on your results: "normal: 77-99mg/dL" (milligrams per deciliter). Reference ranges are based on the normal test results of a large group of healthy people. The range helps show what a typical normal result looks like. But not everyone is typical. Sometimes, healthy people get results outside the reference range, while people with health problems can have results in the normal range. If your results fall outside the reference range, or if you have symptoms despite a normal result, you will likely need more testing. Your lab results may also include one of these terms: Negative or normal, which means the disease or substance being tested was not found Positive or abnormal, which means the disease or substance was found Inconclusive or uncertain, which means there wasn't enough information in the results to diagnose or rule out a disease. If you get an inconclusive result, you will probably get more tests. Tests that measure various organs and systems often give results as reference ranges, while tests that diagnose or rule out diseases often use the terms listed above.1What are false positive and false negative results? A false positive result means your test shows you have a disease or condition, but you don't actually have it. A false negative result means your test shows you don't have a disease or condition, but you actually do. These incorrect results don't happen often, but they are more likely to happen with certain of types tests, or if testing was not done right. Even though false negatives and positives are uncommon, your provider may need to do multiple tests to make sure your diagnosis is correct.1What factors can affect my results? There are many factors that can affect the accuracy of your test results. These include: Certain foods and drinks Medicines Stress Vigorous exercise Variations in lab procedures Having an illness If you have any questions about your lab tests or what your results mean, talk to your health care provider.1References AARP [Internet].

HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD), with millions of Americans currently infected. HPV can infect both men and women. Most people with HPV don't know they have it and never get any symptoms or health problems. There are many different types of HPV. Some types do cause health problems. HPV infections are usually grouped as low-risk or high-risk HPV. Low-Risk HPV can cause warts on the anus and genital area, and sometimes the mouth. Other low-risk HPV infections can cause warts on arms, hands, feet, or chest. HPV warts do not cause serious health problems. They may go away on their own, or a health care provider may remove them in a minor in-office procedure. High-Risk HPV. Most high-risk HPV infections do not cause any symptoms and will go away within a year or two. But some high-risk HPV infections can last for years. These long-lasting infections can lead to cancer. HPV is the cause of most cervical cancers. Long-lasting HPV may also cause other cancers, including those of the anus, vagina, penis, mouth, and throat. An HPV test looks for high-risk HPV in women. Health care providers can usually diagnose low-risk HPV by visually examining the warts. So no testing is needed. While men can be infected with HPV, testing is generally not recommended for men. There is no FDA-approved HPV test for men, and most men with HPV recover from the infection without any symptoms.  Other names: genital human papillomavirus, high risk HPV, HPV DNA, HPV RNA1What is it used for? The test is used to check for the type of HPV that can lead to cervical cancer. It is often done at the same time as a pap smear, a procedure that checks for abnormal cells that can also lead to cervical cancer. When an HPV test and a pap smear are done at the same time, it's called co-testing.1Why do I need an HPV test? You may need an HPV test if you: Are a woman aged 30-65. The American Cancer Society recommends women in this age group have an HPV test with a pap smear (co-testing) every five years. If you are a woman of any age that gets an abnormal result on a pap smear HPV testing in not recommended for women younger than 30 who have had normal pap smear results. Cervical cancer is rare in this age group, but HPV infections are common. Most HPV infections in young women clear up without treatment.1What happens during an HPV test? For an HPV test, you will lie on your back on an exam table, with your knees bent. You will rest your feet in supports called stirrups. Your health care provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to open the vagina, so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a soft brush or plastic spatula to collect cells from the cervix. If you are also getting a pap smear, your provider may use the same sample for both tests, or collect a second sample of cells.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You should not have the test while you are having your period. You should also avoid certain activities before testing. Starting two days before your test, you should not: Use tampons Use vaginal medicines or birth control foams Douche Have sex1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to an HPV test. You may feel some mild discomfort during the procedure. Afterward, you may have a little bleeding or other vaginal discharge.1What do the results mean? Your results will be given as negative, also called normal, or positive, also called abnormal. Negative/Normal. No high-risk HPV was found. Your health care provider may recommend you come back for another screening in five years, or sooner depending on your age and medical history. Positive/Abnormal. High-risk HPV was found. It does not mean you have cancer. It means you may be at higher risk for getting cervical cancer in the future. Your health care provider may order more tests to monitor and/or diagnose your condition. These tests may include: Colposcopy, a procedure in which your provider uses a special magnifying tool (colposcope) to look at the vagina and cervix Cervical Biopsy, a procedure in which your provider takes a sample of tissue from the cervix to look at under a microscope More frequent co-testing (HPV and pap smear) If your results were positive, it's important to get regular or more frequent tests. It can take decades for abnormal cervical cells to turn into cancer. If found early, abnormal cells can be treated before they become cancerous. It's much easier to prevent cervical cancer than to treat it once it develops. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an HPV test? There is no treatment for HPV, but most infections clear up on their own. You can take steps to reduce your risk of getting HPV. Having sex with only one partner and having safe sex (using a condom) can lower your risk. Vaccination is even more effective. The HPV vaccine is a safe, effective way to protect yourself from the HPV infections that commonly cause cancer. The HPV vaccine works best when it's given to someone who has never been exposed to the virus. So it's recommended to give it to people before they start sexual activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend girls and boys get vaccinated starting at age 11 or 12. Usually, a total of two or three HPV shots (vaccinations) are given, spaced a few months apart. The difference in  the number of doses depends on the age of your child or young adult and the recommendations of the health care provider. If you have questions about the HPV vaccine, talk to your child's health care provider and/or your own provider.1References Allina Health [Internet].

A hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to look at the inside of a woman's cervix and uterus. It uses a thin tube called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through the vagina. The tube has a camera on it. The camera sends images of the uterus onto a video screen. The procedure can help diagnose and treat causes of abnormal bleeding, uterine diseases, and other conditions. Other names: hysteroscopic surgery, diagnostic hysteroscopy, operative hysteroscopy1What is it used for? A hysteroscopy is most often used to: Diagnose the cause of abnormal bleeding Help find the cause of infertility, the inability to get pregnant after at least a year of trying Find the cause of repeated miscarriages (more than two miscarriages in a row) Find and remove fibroids and polyps. These are types of abnormal growths in the uterus. They are usually not cancerous. Remove scar tissue from the uterus Remove an intrauterine device (IUD), a small, plastic device placed inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy Perform a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue for testing. Implant a permanent birth control device into the fallopian tubes. Fallopian tubes carry eggs from the ovaries into the uterus during ovulation (the release of an egg during the menstrual cycle).1Why do I need a hysteroscopy? You may need this test if: You are having heavier than normal menstrual periods and/or bleeding between periods. You are bleeding after menopause. You are having trouble getting or staying pregnant. You want a permanent form of birth control. You want to remove an IUD.1What happens during a hysteroscopy? A hysteroscopy is often done in a hospital or outpatient surgery center. The procedure usually includes the following steps: You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown. You will lie on your back on an exam table with your feet in stirrups. An intravenous (IV) line may be put in your arm or hand. You may be given a sedative, a type of medicine to help you relax and block the pain. Some women may be given general anesthesia. General anesthesia is a medicine that will make you unconscious during the procedure. A specially trained doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you this medicine. Your vaginal area will be cleaned with a special soap. Your provider will insert a tool called a speculum into your vagina. It is used to spread open your vaginal walls. Your provider will then insert the hysteroscope into the vagina and move it through your cervix and into your uterus. Your provider will inject a liquid or gas through the hysteroscope and into your uterus. This helps expand the uterus so your provider can get a better view. Your provider will be able to see images of the uterus on a video screen. Your provider may take a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). If you are having a uterine growth removed or another uterine treatment, your provider will insert tools through the hysteroscope to perform the treatment. A hysteroscopy may take 15 minutes to an hour, depending on what was done during the procedure. The medicines you were given may make you drowsy for a while. You should arrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you will be getting general anesthesia, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 6–12 hours before the procedure. Do not use a douche, tampons, or vaginal medicines for 24 hours before the test. It's best to schedule your hysteroscopy when you are not having your menstrual period. If you get your period unexpectedly, tell your health care provider. You may need to reschedule. Also, tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you might be. A hysteroscopy should not be done on pregnant women. The procedure may be harmful to an unborn baby.1Are there any risks to the test? A hysteroscopy is a very safe procedure. You may have mild cramping and a little bloody discharge for a few days after the procedure. Serious complications are rare, but they may include heavy bleeding, infection, and tears in the uterus.1What do the results mean? If your results were not normal, it may mean one of the following conditions: Fibroids, polyps, or other abnormal growths were found. Your provider may be able to remove these growths during the procedure. He or she may also take a sample of the growths for further testing. Scar tissue was found in the uterus. This tissue may be removed during the procedure. The size or shape of the uterus did not look normal. Openings on one or both fallopian tubes are closed. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a hysteroscopy? A hysteroscopy is not recommended for women with cervical cancer or pelvic inflammatory disease.1References ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=92&contentid=P07778 IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1) Test : 1What is an IGF-1 test? This test measures the amount of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in your blood. IGF-1 is a hormone that manages the effects of growth hormone (GH) in your body. Together, IGF-1 and GH promote normal growth of bones and tissues. GH levels in the blood fluctuate throughout the day depending on your diet and activity levels. But IGF-1 levels remain stable. So, an IGF-1 test is a useful way to find out if your body is making a normal amount of GH. Other names: somatomedin C test1What is it used for? An IGF-1 test is used to diagnose growth hormone disorders, including: GH deficiency. In children, GH is essential for normal growth and development. A GH deficiency can cause a child to grow more slowly and be much shorter than children of the same age. In adults, GH deficiency can lead to low bone density and reduced muscle mass. GH insensitivity, also known as Laron syndrome. This is a rare genetic disorder in which the body is unable to use the growth hormone it produces. It also causes slowed growth rate and shorter than normal height in children. Gigantism. This is a rare childhood disorder that causes the body to produce too much growth hormone. Children with gigantism are very tall for their age and have large hands and feet. Acromegaly. This disorder, which affects adults, causes the body to produce too much growth hormone. Adults with acromegaly have thicker than normal bones and enlarged hands, feet, and facial features.1Why do I need an IGF-1 test? Your provider may order an IGF-1 test if you or your child has symptoms of a GH disorder. Symptoms of GH deficiency or GH insensitivity in children include: Slowed growth rate compared with children of the same age Shorter height, arms, and legs, and lower weight than children of the same age Small penis in males Thin hair Poor nail growth Adults with GH deficiency may have symptoms such as fatigue and decreased bone density and muscle mass. But IGF-1 testing isn't common for adults, as other disorders are much more likely to cause these symptoms. Symptoms of GH excess (gigantism) in children include: Excessive growth compared with children of the same age Overly large head Larger than normal hands and feet Mild to moderate obesity Symptoms of GH excess (acromegaly) in adults include: Deep, husky voice Larger than normal facial features such as lips, nose, and tongue Excessive sweating and body odor Thickening of bones Coarse, oily skin Irregular menstrual cycles in women Erectile dysfunction in men1What happens during an IGF-1 test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You don't need any special preparations for an IGF-1 test.1Are there any risks to this test? There is very little risk to you or your child in having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your child's results show lower than normal levels of IGF-1, it probably means he or she has a GH deficiency or insensitivity to GH. In a child, this may be caused by a genetic disorder or brain disease. Your child may benefit from treatment with GH supplementation. GH supplementation is an injected medicine that contains manufactured human growth hormone. When GH deficiency is diagnosed and treated early, some children can grow several inches in the first year of treatment. Others grow less, and more slowly, but still benefit from treatment. If your results show lower than normal IGF-1, it may be due to a normal age-related decrease in the hormone or other condition. Your provider may order more tests to help make a diagnosis. Higher than normal levels of IGF-1 may mean gigantism in children or acromegaly in adults. Gigantism and acromegaly are most often caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland, a small organ in the base of the brain that controls many functions, including growth. Treatment for the tumor may include radiation therapy, surgery, and/or medicine. If the disorder was not caused by a tumor, you or your child may need more tests. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an IGF-1 test? Your provider may order other blood tests to help diagnose a GH disorder. These include: A GH stimulation test, which helps diagnose a GH deficiency or insensitivit A GH suppression test, which helps diagnose a GH excess IGBP-3 test. IGBP-3 is a protein that is the main carrier of IGF-1. This test can help diagnose a GH deficiency, GH insensitivity, or GH excess.1References Hormone Health Network [Internet].

An immunofixation blood test, also known as protein electrophoresis, measures certain proteins in the blood. Proteins play many important roles, including providing energy for the body, rebuilding muscles, and supporting the immune system. There are two main types of proteins in the blood: albumin and globulin. The test separates these proteins into subgroups based on their size and electrical charge. The subgroups are: Albumin Alpha-1 globulin Alpha-2 globulin Beta globulin Gamma globulin Measuring the proteins in each subgroup can help diagnose a variety of diseases. Other names: serum protein electrophoresis, (SPEP), protein electrophoresis, SPE,  immunofixation electrophoresis, IFE, serum immunofixation1What is it used for? This test is most often used to help diagnose or monitor a variety of different conditions. These include: Multiple myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells Other forms of cancer, such as lymphoma (cancer of the immune system) or leukemia (cancer of blood-forming tissues, such as bone marrow) Kidney disease Liver disease Certain neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases causes your immune system to attack your own cells, tissues, and/or organs by mistake.  Malnutrition or malabsorption, conditions in which your body is not getting enough nutrients from the foods you eat1Why do I need an IFE test? You may need testing if you have symptoms of certain diseases, such as multiple myeloma, multiple sclerosis, malnutrition, or malabsorption. Symptoms of multiple myeloma include: Bone pain Fatigue Anemia (low level of red blood cells) Frequent infections Excessive thirst Nausea Symptoms of multiple sclerosis include: Numbness or tingling in the face, arms and/or legs Trouble walking Fatigue Weakness Dizziness and vertigo Problems controlling urination Symptoms of malnutrition or malabsorption include: Weakness Fatigue Weight loss Nausea and vomiting Bone and joint pain1What happens during an IFE test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an immunofixation blood test.1Are there any risks to an IFE test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will show that your protein levels are in the normal range, too high, or too low. High protein levels may be caused by many conditions. Common causes of high levels include: Dehydration Liver disease Inflammatory diseases, a condition when the body's immune system attacks healthy tissues by mistake. Inflammatory diseases include rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Inflammatory diseases are similar to autoimmune diseases, but they affect different parts of the immune system. Kidney disease High cholesterol Iron-deficiency anemia Multiple myeloma Lymphoma Certain infections Low protein levels may be caused by many conditions. Common causes of low levels include: Kidney disease Liver disease Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, an inherited disorder that can lead to lung disease at an early age Malnutrition Certain autoimmune disorders Your diagnosis will depend on which specific protein levels were not normal, and whether the levels were too high or too low. It may also depend on the unique patterns made by the proteins. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an IFE test? Immunofixation tests can also be done in urine. Urine IFE tests are often done if IFE blood test results were not normal.1References Cancer.Net [Internet]. Alexandria (VA): American Society of Clinical Oncology; 2005–2019.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw43650  Immunoglobulins Blood Test : 1What is an immunoglobulins blood test? This test measures the amount of immunoglobulins in your blood. Immunoglobulins are also called antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight germs, such as viruses and bacteria.  When you're exposed to germs, your body makes unique antibodies that are specifically designed to destroy only those germs. An immunoglobulins test usually measures three main types of immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies that do different jobs to protect your health: IgM antibodies are the first immunoglobulins your body makes after you're exposed to germs. They provide short-term protection while your body makes other antibodies. IgM antibodies are in your blood and lymph fluid (a watery fluid that carries the cells that fight infections and diseases to all parts of your body). IgG antibodies are very important for fighting infections from bacteria and viruses. Most of the immunoglobulins in your blood are IgG. You also have some IgG antibodies in all your body fluids. Your body keeps a "blueprint" of all the IgG antibodies you have made. That way, if you're exposed to the same germs again, your immune system can quickly make more antibodies. IgA antibodies protect your respiratory tract (the organs you use to breathe) and your digestive system (the organs you use to eat and digest food) from infections. You have IgA antibodies in your blood, saliva, and gastric "juices." An immunoglobulins blood test measures the amounts of IgM, IgG, and IgA in your blood to help diagnose different types of health conditions that may affect your immune system. Other names: quantitative immunoglobulins, total immunoglobulins, IgG, IgM, IgA testing1What is it used for? An immunoglobulins blood test may be used to: Check the health of your immune system if you are often sick with infections or diarrhea Help diagnose and monitor a variety of conditions that may cause abnormal levels of IgM, IgG, and/or IgA, such as:

Autoimmune disorders. With these disorders your immune system attacks your own healthy cells by mistake, including cells that make immunoglobulins. Examples of autoimmune disorders include rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
Certain types of cancer that affect your bone marrow, blood, or immune system
Chronic (long-term) infections
Genetic diseases you're born with (uncommon)

 Autoimmune disorders. With these disorders your immune system attacks your own healthy cells by mistake, including cells that make immunoglobulins. Examples of autoimmune disorders include rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Certain types of cancer that affect your bone marrow, blood, or immune system Chronic (long-term) infections Genetic diseases you're born with (uncommon) Check for certain infections a baby may be born with, including syphilis or toxoplasmosis1Why do I need an immunoglobulins blood test? You may need this test if you have symptoms that could mean your immunoglobulin levels are too low. If you have too few immunoglobulins, you have an immunodeficiency. Symptoms of low levels of immunoglobulins usually include having many, repeated infections and other problems, such as: Sinus, throat, and ear infections Respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis Diarrhea Serious infections from germs that don't usually cause problems in healthy people, such as:

Cytomegalovirus (a virus related to chickenpox)
A yeast infection in the mouth, eyes, or digestive tract (thrush)

 Cytomegalovirus (a virus related to chickenpox) A yeast infection in the mouth, eyes, or digestive tract (thrush) You may need an immunoglobulins test if immunodeficiency runs in your family, or your health care provider thinks you may have a problem making normal levels of immunoglobulins. You may also need this test if your provider thinks you may have high levels of immunoglobulins from an autoimmune disease or a cancer that affects your blood, bone marrow, and/or immune system. These cancers may cause a very high level of certain immunoglobulins. But those immunoglobulins don't work normally. So, even though your levels are high, you may have frequent infections and other symptoms of low immunoglobulin levels.1What happens during an immunoglobulins blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an immunoglobulins blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider will compare your levels of IgM, IgG, and IgA. Your results can mean different things, depending on which immunoglobulins are high or low, your symptoms, and any conditions you may have. An immunoglobulins blood test alone cannot diagnose any conditions. So if your results aren't normal, you'll probably need more testing to find out what's affecting your immune system. Some possible causes of low levels of one or more immunoglobulins are: Conditions that may reduce the amount of protein in your body, including:

Kidney disease
Serious burns
Certain malabsorption disorders
Malnutrition

 Kidney disease Serious burns Certain malabsorption disorders Malnutrition Conditions that affect your ability to make immunoglobulins, including:

Complications from diabetes
Kidney failure

 Complications from diabetes Kidney failure A genetic disease that you were born with, such as common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) Some possible causes of high levels of one or more immunoglobulins are: An autoimmune disease Hepatitis Cirrhosis A chronic infection Certain cancers. These cancers often cause a very high level of one type of immunoglobulin and low levels for the other types:

Multiple myeloma
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
Lymphoma
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia

 Multiple myeloma Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Lymphoma Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia If your immunoglobulin levels aren't normal, it doesn't always mean you have a condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines can affect your results. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an immunoglobulins blood test? If your symptoms suggest that an immune condition may be affecting your spine or brain, your provider may order an immunoglobulin test on a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If your symptoms include frequent colds, sinus infections, or diarrhea, your saliva may be tested for IgA levels.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw41342 Insulin in Blood : 1What is an insulin in blood test? This test measures the amount of insulin in your blood. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar, known as glucose, from your bloodstream into your cells. Glucose comes from the foods you eat and drink. It is your body's main source of energy. Insulin plays a key role in keeping glucose at the right levels. If glucose levels are too high or too low, it can cause serious health problems. Glucose levels that are not normal are known as: Hyperglycemia, blood glucose levels that are too high. It happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin. If there's not enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells. It stays in the bloodstream instead. Hypoglycemia, blood glucose levels that are too low. If your body sends too much insulin into the blood, too much glucose will go into your cells. This leaves less in the bloodstream. Diabetes is the most common cause of abnormal glucose levels. There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin at all. This can cause hyperglycemia. Type 2 Diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but the cells in your body don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance often develops before type 2 diabetes. At first, insulin resistance causes the body to make extra insulin, to make up for ineffective insulin. Extra insulin in the bloodstream can cause hypoglycemia. But insulin resistance tends to get worse over time. Eventually, it decreases your body's ability to make insulin. As insulin levels drop, blood sugar levels rise. If levels don't return to normal, you may get type 2 diabetes. Other names: fasting insulin, insulin serum, total and free insulin1What is it used for? An insulin in blood test is most often used to: Find out the cause of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) Diagnose or monitor insulin resistance Monitor the condition of people with type 2 diabetes Find out if there is a type of tumor on the pancreas, known as an insulinoma. If the tumor has been removed, the test may be used to see if it has been done successfully. An insulin in blood test is sometimes used along with other tests to help diagnose and monitor type 1 diabetes. These other tests may include glucose and hemoglobin AIC testing.1Why do I need an insulin in blood test? You may need an insulin in blood test if you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). These include: Sweating Trembling Irregular heartbeat Confusion Dizziness Blurred vision Extreme hunger You may also need this test if other tests, such as a blood glucose test, show you have low blood sugar.1What happens during an insulin in blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your insulin levels were too high, it may mean you have: Type 2 diabetes Insulin resistance Hypoglycemia Cushing's syndrome, a disorder of the adrenal glands. Adrenal glands make hormones that help the body break down fat and protein. An insulinoma (pancreatic tumor) If insulin levels were too low, it may mean you have: Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) Type 1 diabetes Pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I should know about an insulin in blood test? Insulin and glucose work together. So your health care provider may compare your insulin in blood results with blood glucose test results before making a diagnosis.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet].

Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) : 1What is an intravenous pyelogram (IVP)? An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) uses x-rays to take pictures of the organs of your urinary tract. These are the organs that make urine (pee) and remove it from your body. They include your: Kidneys, two organs located below the rib cage, one on each side of your spine. They filter your blood to remove waste and extra water in urine (pee). Bladder, a hollow organ in your pelvis (the area below your belly). It stores urine. Ureters, thin tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder. IVP uses contrast dye to make these organs show up well on x-ray images. In males, x-rays from an IVP can also show the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder and makes the fluid part of semen. During an IVP, contrast dye is injected into a vein using an intravenous (IV) line. The dye travels through your bloodstream to your kidneys, which filter it out. The dye collects in the organs of your urinary tract and makes them look bright white on the x-rays. This allows your health care provider to see blockages or other problems that affect your urinary organs. IVP isn't commonly used anymore. Instead, providers usually order CT (computerized tomography) scans to see the urinary tract. CT scans can provide more information than x-rays from an IVP. But IVP may be useful in certain situations. Your provider can explain the pros and cons of having an IVP or a CT scan. In certain cases, MRI scans (magnetic resonance imaging) or ultrasound may also be options for looking at the urinary tract. Other names: excretory urography, intravenous urography1What is it used for? An IVP may be used to help find the cause of symptoms that may involve the urinary tract or prostate. It can be used to help diagnose disorders such as: Kidney stones Stones in the bladder or ureters Kidney cysts Enlarged prostate (BPH) Tumors in the kidneys, bladder, or ureters (cancerous and not cancerous) Birth defects that affect the structure of the urinary tract Scarring from a urinary tract infection (UTI) IVP usually isn't used during pregnancy or for infants and children.1Why do I need an IVP? You may need an IVP if you have symptoms of a urinary tract disorder. These may include: Pain in your side or back Sharp pains in your abdomen (belly), side, groin or back Blood in your urine Cloudy or bad-smelling urine Pain when urinating (peeing) Needing to urinate frequently, or not being able to urinate Nausea and vomiting Swelling in your feet or legs Fever and chills You may also need an IVP if you have had many urinary tract infections or have had an injury that may have damaged your urinary organs.1What happens during an IVP? An IVP may be done in your provider's office or a hospital. The test is often done by a radiology technician (a health care professional who is trained to do x-ray exams). The procedure takes about an hour and generally includes these steps: You'll usually remove your clothing and put on a gown. You'll lie down on your back on an x-ray table. The technician will take an x-ray to make sure the machine is set right for you. The technician will insert an IV into a vein in your arm or hand and inject the contrast dye. Several x-rays will be taken to see how your kidneys filter the dye. You may be asked to move into different positions. The technician may wrap a special belt tightly around your belly. This helps keep the contrast dye in your kidneys. After the belt is removed, more x-rays will be taken to show the dye passing from your kidneys through your ureters and into your bladder. Before the IVP is finished, you'll be asked to use the bathroom or a bedpan to urinate. Then the last x-rays will be taken to see if any urine remains in your bladder. This shows how well your bladder works to empty urine. After the test, drinking plenty of fluids will help flush the contrast dye out of your body.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your provider will give you instructions for how to prepare for an IVP. You will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) after midnight on the night before your test. You may also be asked to take a mild laxative the evening before the IVP. A laxative is medicine that helps you empty your bowels (poop).1Are there any risks to the test? There's a small chance you could have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye. Reactions can often be managed with medicine. Serious reactions are rare. But certain conditions may increase the chance of problems, such as having other allergies, congestive heart failure, or diabetes. If you have any of these conditions, tell your provider. You may be able to take medicine before the IVP to reduce the chance of reacting to the dye. When the contrast dye is injected, you may feel itchy, warm, or queasy. Some people have a metallic taste in their mouths. These feelings are harmless and usually go away quickly. Tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. An IVP delivers a low dose of radiation. The dose is safe for most people, but it can be harmful to an unborn baby.1What do the results mean? Your IVP images will be studied by a diagnostic radiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in examining x-rays, MRIs, and other medical images to diagnose medical conditions. The radiologist will send a report with your IVP results to your provider. The report will explain exactly what the x-rays showed. In general: Normal results mean that:

The organs of your urinary tract looked normal, and no blockages were seen.
Your kidneys, ureters, and bladder worked normally to filter the dye and pass it out of your body.
In males, the prostate was the right size, and no problems were seen.

 The organs of your urinary tract looked normal, and no blockages were seen. Your kidneys, ureters, and bladder worked normally to filter the dye and pass it out of your body. In males, the prostate was the right size, and no problems were seen. Abnormal results mean that something irregular was found on your IVP images. Ask your provider to explain your report and diagnosis. Examples of abnormal results include:

One or more of urinary tract organs did not appear to be the right size or shape, or it was not in the usual place.
A tumor, stone, cyst, injury, scar, or some other abnormal area of tissue was found and may be blocking the flow of urine.
Your urinary tract did not filter the dye and/or pass it out of your body as quickly or completely as it should.
In males, the prostate was larger than normal.

Iron tests measure different substances in the blood to check iron levels in your body. Iron is a mineral that's essential for making red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organ function. Iron levels that are too low or too high can cause serious health problems. Different types of iron tests include: Serum iron test, which measures the amount of iron in the blood Transferrin test, which measures transferrin, a protein that moves iron throughout the body Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), which measures how well iron attaches to transferrin and other proteins in the blood Ferritin blood test, which measures how much iron is stored in the body Some or all of these tests are often ordered at the same time. Other names: Fe tests, iron indices1What are they used for? Iron tests are most often used to: Check if your iron levels are too low, a sign of anemia Diagnose different types of anemia Check if your iron levels are too high, which could be a sign of hemochromatosis. This is a rare genetic disorder that causes too much iron to build up in the body. See if treatments for iron deficiency (low iron levels) or excess iron (high iron levels) are working1Why do I need an iron test? You may need testing if you have symptoms of iron levels that are too low or too high. Symptoms of iron levels that are too low include: Pale skin Fatigue Weakness Dizziness Shortness of breath Rapid heartbeat Symptoms of iron levels that are too high include: Joint pain Abdominal pain Lack of energy Weight loss1What happens during an iron test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your health care provider may ask you to fast (not eat or drink) for 12 hours before your test. The test is usually done in the morning. If you have any questions about how to prepare for your test, talk to your health care provider.1Are there any risks to iron tests?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If one or more iron test results show your iron levels are too low, it may mean you have: Iron deficiency anemia, a common type of anemia. Anemia is a disorder in which your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. Another type of anemia Thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder that causes the body to make fewer than normal healthy red blood cells If one or more iron test results show your iron levels are too high, it may mean you have: Hemochromatosis, a disorder that causes too much iron to build up in the body Lead poisoning Liver disease Most conditions that cause too little or too much iron can be successfully treated with iron supplements, diet, medicines, and/or other therapies. If your iron test results are not normal, it does not necessarily mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. Some medicines, including birth control pills and estrogen treatments, can affect iron levels. Iron levels may also be lower for women during their menstrual cycles.  If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about iron tests? Your health care provider may order other blood tests to help check your iron levels. These include: Hemoglobin test Hematocrit test Complete blood count Mean corpuscular volume1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw41550 Karyotype Genetic Test : 1What is a karyotype test? A karyotype test is a type of genetic testing. It looks at the size, shape, and number of chromosomes in a sample of cells from your body. Chromosomes are found in the cell nucleus, which is like the command center of a cell. Chromosomes contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. You inherit your chromosomes from your parents. Normally, all your cells (except for egg and sperm cells) have a set of the same 46 chromosomes. The chromosomes are grouped into 23 pairs. Each pair has two chromosomes, one coming from each parent. You may develop certain genetic disorders if your cells: Are missing whole chromosomes or pieces of chromosomes Have extra chromosomes or extra pieces of chromosomes A karyotype test checks the chromosomes in your cells to: See whether you have a full set of 46 chromosomes. Having too many or too few chromosomes can cause serious problems with health, growth, and normal development, such as Down syndrome (extra chromosome 21)  and Turner syndrome (missing X chromosome). Look for changes in the structure of chromosomes, such as broken, missing, or extra parts. These changes may cause a wide variety of problems depending on which chromosome is affected. But some changes in chromosomes don't cause problems. Certain chromosome problems are present from birth. Chromosome problems can also develop in certain cells after birth. These problems can cause specific types of cancer. Other names: genetic testing, chromosome testing, chromosome studies, cytogenetic analysis1What is it used for? A karyotype test looks for unusual changes in chromosomes. It may be used to: Check you and/or your family members for specific chromosome problems if you:

Have a genetic disorder that runs in your family
Have symptoms that may be from a genetic disorder

 Have a genetic disorder that runs in your family Have symptoms that may be from a genetic disorder Check an unborn baby for chromosome problems Find out if abnormal chromosomes are causing problems having children, including:

Male or female infertility
Miscarriages, if you have lost two or more pregnancies before 20 weeks
Stillbirth

 Male or female infertility Miscarriages, if you have lost two or more pregnancies before 20 weeks Stillbirth Help diagnose and/or make treatment decisions for certain types of cancer and blood disorders1Why do I need a karyotype test? You may need a karyotype test if: You're planning to have children or are pregnant:

To learn whether you and/or your partner have abnormal chromosomes that you could pass on to a baby
To find out why you're having problems getting pregnant or having miscarriages
To check your unborn baby for genetic disorders, especially if the baby has a high risk for problems. The risk may be high if:

The pregnant parent is age 35 or older. The overall risk of genetic birth defects is small, but the risk increases after age 35.
Either parent has a genetic disorder, a family history of a genetic disorder, or another child with a genetic disorder.
The results of certain prenatal screening tests weren't normal.

You have a family history of a chromosomal disorder and want to know your risk for developing the disorder. You and/or your child have symptoms of a genetic disorder. Each type of genetic disorder has different symptoms. Karyotype testing may be needed to make a diagnosis. You've been diagnosed with certain cancers or blood disorders that often involve changes in chromosomes. These changes can affect how your disease will behave and which treatment will work best for you. Karyotype testing may be needed to help diagnose and treat conditions such as:

Leukemia
Lymphoma
Multiple myeloma
Anemia

 Leukemia Lymphoma Multiple myeloma Anemia1What happens during a karyotype test? For a karyotype test, the type of sample you provide depends on the reason for the test. To test the chromosomes of an unborn baby, the sample may be gathered using: Amniocentesis. This procedure collects a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the unborn baby during pregnancy. The fluid contains cells from the baby that can be tested. Amniocentesis is usually done between week 15 and 20 of pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This procedure collects tissue from the chorionic villi, which are parts of the placenta that usually have the same chromosomes as the unborn baby. (The placenta is the organ that grows in the uterus to provide nutrients and oxygen to the baby.) A CVS is usually done between week 10 and 13 of pregnancy. To test the chromosomes of adults, children, and babies, the sample may be from: A blood test. This is the most common sample used for karyotype tests. A health care professional will use a small needle to remove a blood sample from a vein in your arm. A buccal (cheek) swab. A health care professional will insert a swab into your mouth and rub it across the inside of your cheek to gather a sample of cells. A bone marrow test. This test may be used if you have a certain type of cancer or blood disorder. Marrow is soft, spongy tissue found inside of bones. Most bone marrow samples are taken from the back of the hip bone.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? For a CVS or amniocentesis, you may need to drink extra fluid and not urinate before your test so that your bladder is full. A blood test or cheek swab usually don't require any preparation. If you're having a bone marrow test, ask your provider for instructions about how to prepare.1Are there any risks to the test?  During amniocentesis or CVS, you may feel mild stinging or cramping. Both procedures are safe, but they do have a slight risk of causing miscarriage. Talk with your provider about the risks and benefits of these tests. A blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. A cheek swab has no risk. After a bone marrow test, you may feel stiff or sore where the sample was taken. This usually goes away in a few days. Serious risks are rare.1What do the results mean? A normal or negative result means that there were 46 chromosomes in the sample without any unusual changes in their structure. An abnormal or positive result means that unusual changes in the number or structure of chromosomes were found. Abnormal results can mean many things about your health or your child's health depending on the chromosome changes that were found. Talk with your provider to learn what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a karyotype test? If you're thinking about having a karyotype test or have received abnormal results, it may help to talk with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors can give you information about how genetic conditions might affect you or your family. They can help you find support services and make informed decisions about treatment or management options for a genetic disorder.1References ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw6392 Ketones in Blood : 1What is a ketones in blood test? A ketones in blood test measures the level of ketones in your blood. Ketones are acids that your body makes when it breaks down fat for energy. Normally, the cells in your body use blood glucose (sugar) for energy. You get glucose from eating carbohydrates. If your cells can't get enough glucose, your body will break down fat for energy instead. This process produces ketones. If your body breaks down fat too fast, ketones can build up in your blood and urine. High ketone levels make your blood too acidic. This is a serious condition called ketoacidosis. The most common type of ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a medical emergency that often develops quickly and can lead to a coma and be life-threatening. If you have diabetes, a ketones in blood test can help find high ketone levels early so you can get treatment right away. If your health care provider recommends frequent testing to check for increasing ketone levels, at-home blood testing meters are available that check both glucose levels and ketones. At-home testing for ketones in urine testing may also be an option. Talk with your provider about which is right for you. Other names: Ketone bodies (blood), serum ketones, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetate, nitroprusside test1What is it used for? With diabetes: A ketones in blood test is mostly used to check for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in people with diabetes. DKA can affect anyone with diabetes, but it is most common with type 1 diabetes.  With type 2 diabetes, DKA is less common. If you have diabetes, a blood ketones test may be used when you are sick or pregnant. You may also be tested if you develop diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). If you don't have diabetes, you may have your blood ketones checked if you are at risk for developing ketoacidosis and you have symptoms. You are at risk for ketoacidosis if you have a condition that causes your body to use fat for energy instead of glucose, such as: An eating disorder Frequent vomiting or diarrhea Alcohol use disorder1Why do I need a ketones in blood test? You may need a ketones in blood test if you have diabetes and symptoms of DKA, such as: Feeling very thirsty Urinating (peeing) a lot more than usual Nausea and vomiting Abdominal (belly) pain Dry skin and mouth Fast, deep breathing Breath that has a fruity smell Headache Muscle stiffness or aches Fatigue  Confusion If you don't have diabetes, you may need a ketones in blood test if you have symptoms of ketoacidosis that could be from another condition. You may also need the test if you have symptoms, and you eat a low-carbohydrate "keto" diet for weight loss.1What happens during a ketones in blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. To check blood ketones at home, you may use a blood glucose meter that also tests for ketones. You will use a device to prick your finger. You'll collect a drop of blood on a ketone test strip that is inserted into the meter. The meter will show your ketone levels. Follow the instructions carefully. You can also test for ketones in urine using an at-home kit. Ask your provider how you should test for ketones, when you should test, and what to do if your levels are high.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a ketones in blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A normal or negative test result usually means that your body is not making too many ketones and you don't have ketoacidosis. But a normal test result doesn't always rule out diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). That's because your body makes three types of ketones. If DKA is in the early stages, only one type of ketone will be high, and lab tests often don't measure this type of ketone. A high or positive test result means you have ketones in your blood. It's normal to have some blood ketones, but if your levels are very high and you have symptoms, you may have ketoacidosis. If you have diabetes, you likely have DKA. If you don't have diabetes, you may have ketoacidosis from alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, not eating for very long periods of time, or other conditions. Ketoacidosis from any cause must be treated. Treatment may include going to the hospital. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a ketones in blood test? People who eat a low-carbohydrate keto diet to lose weight will have blood ketone levels that are higher, but are not high enough to be ketoacidosis. This condition is called ketosis. Ketosis doesn't make your blood too acidic because your body is able to use the ketones, so they don't build up. But it's possible to develop ketoacidosis on a keto diet, so it's important to talk with your provider to see if it's safe for you.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw7738 Ketones in Urine : 1What is a Ketones in Urine Test? A ketones in urine test measures ketone levels in your urine. Normally, the cells in your body use glucose (sugar) from your blood for energy. If your cells can't get enough glucose, your body breaks down fat for energy instead. This produces an acid called ketones, which can build up in your blood and urine. Having some ketones in your urine is normal. But high ketone levels in urine may be a sign that your body is too acidic. This condition is called ketoacidosis. The most common type of ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that often develops quickly and can even be life-threatening. If you have diabetes, a ketones in urine test can help find high ketone levels early so you can  get treatment right away. Home tests are available if your health care provider recommends frequent testing. Other names: ketones urine test, ketone test, urine ketones, ketone bodies1What is it used for? A ketones in urine test is often used to help monitor people who are more likely to develop high levels of ketones. Your risk increases if you have a medical condition, diet, or exercise habits that cause your body to use fat for energy instead of glucose, such as:  Diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening condition caused by high ketone levels. It's most common in people who have type 1 diabetes. But people who have type 2 diabetes can also develop DKA. Vomiting or diarrhea that lasts a long time Alcohol use disorder (AUD), which can cause alcoholic ketoacidosis Eating disorders and starvation Certain digestive diseases Eating a "keto diet," which is low in carbohydrates (foods that supply glucose for energy) Exercising too hard for a long time Pregnancy1Why do I need a ketones in urine test? Your health care provider may order a ketones in urine test if you have diabetes or other conditions that increase your risk for developing high ketone levels. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of ketoacidosis, including: Nausea or vomiting Pain in your abdomen (belly) Confusion Trouble breathing Feeling very tired or sleepy1What happens during a ketones in urine test? A ketones in urine test can be done in the home or in a lab. If you go to a lab for your test, a health care professional will give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test. If you do the test at home, follow the instructions that are in your test kit. Your kit will include a package of test strips. You will either hold a test strip in your urine stream or dip it into a cup of urine that you collect with the clean-catch method. It's important to follow the test instructions exactly.  Talk with your provider if you have any questions about how you should test for ketones in urine.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may have to fast (not eat or drink) for a certain period of time before taking a ketones in urine test. Ask your provider if you need to fast or do any other type of preparation before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a ketones in urine test.1What do the results mean? Your test results may be a specific number or listed as a "small," "moderate," or "large" amount of ketones. Normal results can vary depending on your diet, activity level, and other factors. Because high ketone levels can cause serious health problems , be sure to talk with your provider about what is normal for you and what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a ketones in urine test? Ketone test kits are available at most pharmacies without a prescription. If you are planning to test for ketones at home, ask your provider which kit would be best for you. At-home urine tests are easy to do and can provide accurate results as long as you carefully follow all instructions. Some people use at-home kits to test for ketones if they are on a ketogenic or "keto" diet to try to lose weight. On a keto diet you eat mainly foods with little or no carbohydrates. This makes your body use fat instead of glucose for energy, which may increase your ketone levels. A keto diet may not be right for people with certain conditions. Talk with your provider before going on a keto diet to see if it is right for you.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995-2022.

Kidney stones are small, pebble-like pieces of material that form in one or both of your kidneys. Kidney stones form when you have high levels of certain minerals or salts in your urine (pee). A kidney stone analysis is a test to find out what a kidney stone is made of. This information helps your health care provider develop a plan to help you reduce your risk of forming more stones in the future. There are four main types of kidney stones: Calcium is the most common type of stone. Uric acid is another common type of stone. Cystine is an uncommon type of stone. It is caused by cystinuria, a kidney disease that you inherit from your parents. Struvite is the most uncommon type of stone. It usually forms after a urinary tract infection (UTI). Kidney stones can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pea, and sometimes even larger. Very small stones may pass out of your body when you urinate (pee). Larger or odd-shaped stones can get stuck inside your urinary tract and block the flow of urine. This may cause severe pain or bleeding, and you may need treatment to get rid of the stones. But with treatment, kidney stones usually don't cause permanent damage. Other names: urinary stone analysis, renal calculus analysis1What is it used for? A kidney stone analysis is used to find out what your kidney stone is made of. This helps your provider understand why the stone formed and what will help prevent more stones from forming in the future. This is important because once you've had a stone, you're likely to get another one.1Why do I need a kidney stone analysis? You may need a kidney stone analysis if you have symptoms that could be from a kidney stone. These include: Sharp pain in your abdomen (belly), side, groin, or back Blood in your urine Frequent need to urinate Not being able to urinate at all or only urinating a little bit Pain when urinating Cloudy or bad-smelling urine Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills1What happens during a kidney stone analysis? To collect a kidney stone, you will need a kidney stone strainer to filter your urine and a clean container for your stone. A kidney stone strainer is a device made of fine mesh or gauze. Your provider may give you a strainer, or you may get one from a drug store. To collect your stone, you will: Filter all your urine through the strainer. Check the strainer carefully after each time you urinate to look for a stone. It may look like a grain of sand or a tiny piece of gravel. If you find a stone, put it in a clean container with a lid. DO NOT add anything to the container. The stone must be kept dry. DO NOT put tape or tissue on the stone. Return the container to your provider or lab as instructed. A stone may pass at any time of the day or night. So, it's important to filter all your urine every time you urinate until you find a stone. Your provider may tell you to drink a lot of water to help pass the stone. If you have pain while the stone is passing, ask your provider about pain medicine. If your kidney stone is too large to pass, you may need a minor surgical procedure to remove the stone for testing. If you've already passed a kidney stone and you kept it, ask your provider about  testing it.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a kidney stone analysis.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a kidney stone analysis. But passing a kidney stone may cause: Pain depending on the size of the stone A urinary tract infection A blocked urinary tract if the stone gets stuck1What do the results mean? Your results will show what your kidney stone is made of. With this information, your provider will be able to recommend steps and/or medicines to help prevent more stones from forming. Your treatment plan will depend on the type of stone you have, but most plans include drinking plenty of water and changing some of the foods you eat. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a kidney stone analysis? Calcium stones are the most common type, but they are not caused by eating dairy products. In fact, dairy products can help prevent calcium stones. Your provider can explain what diet changes can help reduce your risk for stones. This is important because kidney stones increase your risk for developing chronic kidney disease.1References Johns Hopkins Medicine [Internet]. Johns Hopkins Medicine; c2022.

This test measures the level of the different lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes in the blood. LDH, also known as lactic acid dehydrogenase, is a type of protein, known as an enzyme. LDH plays an important role in making your body's energy. It is found in almost all the body's tissues. There are five types of LDH. They are known as isoenzymes. The five isoenzymes are found in different amounts in tissues throughout the body. LDH-1: found in heart and red blood cells LDH-2: found in white blood cells. It is also found in heart and red blood cells, but in lesser amounts than LDH-1. LDH-3: found in lung tissue LDH-4: found in white blood cells, kidney and pancreas cells, and lymph nodes LDH-5: found in the liver and muscles of skeleton When tissues are damaged or diseased, they release LDH isoenzymes into the bloodstream. The type of LDH isoenzyme released depends on which tissues are damaged. This test can help your provider find out the location and cause of your tissue damage. Other names: LD isoenzyme, lactic dehydrogenase isoenzyme1What is it used for? An LDH isoenzymes test is used to find out the location, type, and severity of tissue damage. It can help diagnose a number of different conditions including: Recent heart attack Anemia Kidney disease Liver disease, including hepatitis and cirrhosis Pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening blood clot in the lungs1Why do I need an LDH isoenzymes test? You may need this test if your health care provider suspects that you have tissue damage based on your symptoms and/or other tests. An LDH isoenzymes test is often done as a follow-up to a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test. An LDH test also measures LDH levels, but it doesn't provide information on the location or type of tissue damage.1What happens during an LDH isoenzymes test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an LDH isoenzymes test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results showed that levels of one or more LDH isoenzymes were not normal, it probably means you have some kind of tissue disease or damage. The type of disease or damage will depend on which LDH isoenzymes had abnormal levels. Disorders that cause abnormal LDH levels include: Anemia Kidney disease Liver disease Muscle injury Heart attack Pancreatitis Infectious mononucleosis (mono) If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

This test measures the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), also known as lactic acid dehydrogenase, in your blood or sometimes in other body fluids. LDH is a type of protein, known as an enzyme. LDH plays an important role in making your body's energy. It is found in almost all the body's tissues, including those in the blood, heart, kidneys, brain, and lungs. When these tissues are damaged, they release LDH into the bloodstream or other body fluids. If your LDH blood or fluid levels are high, it may mean certain tissues in your body have been damaged by disease or injury. Other names: LD test, lactic dehydrogenase, lactic acid dehydrogenase1What is it used for? An LDH test is most often used to: Find out if you have tissue damage Monitor disorders that cause tissue damage. These include anemia, liver disease, lung disease, and some types of infections. Monitor chemotherapy for certain types cancer. The test may show if treatment is working.1Why do I need an LDH test? You may need this test if other tests and/or your symptoms indicate you have tissue damage or disease. Symptoms will vary depending on the type of tissue damage you have. You may also need an LDH test if you are currently being treated for cancer.1What happens during an LDH test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. LDH is sometimes measured in other body fluids, including fluids in the spinal cord, lungs, or abdomen. If you are having one of these tests, your health care provider will give more information about the procedure.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an LDH blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Higher than normal LDH levels usually means you have some type of tissue damage or disease. Disorders that cause high LDH levels include: Anemia Kidney disease Liver disease Muscle injury Heart attack Pancreatitis Infections, including meningitis, encephalitis, and infectious mononucleosis (mono) Certain types of cancer, including lymphoma and leukemia. A higher than normal LDH level may also mean treatment for cancer is not working. Although the test can show if you have tissue damage or disease, it does not show where the damage is located. If your results showed higher than normal LDH levels, your provider may need to order more tests to make a diagnosis. One of these tests may be an LDH isoenzyme test. An LDH isoenzyme test measures different forms of LDH. It can help your provider find out about the location, type, and severity of tissue damage.

This test measures the level of lactic acid, also known as lactate, in your blood. Lactic acid is a substance made by muscle tissue and by red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs to other parts of your body. Normally, the level of lactic acid in the blood is low. Lactic acid levels rise when oxygen levels decrease. Low oxygen levels may be caused by: Strenuous exercise Heart failure Severe infection Shock, a dangerous condition that limits blood flow to your organs and tissues If lactic acid levels get too high, it can lead to a life-threatening condition known as lactic acidosis. A lactic acid test can help diagnose lactic acidosis before it causes serious complications. Other names: lactate test, lactic acid: plasma1What is it used for? A lactic acid test is most often used to diagnose lactic acidosis. The test may also be used to: Help find out if enough oxygen is reaching the body's tissues Help diagnose sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to a bacterial infection If meningitis is suspected, the test may also be used to help find out if it is caused by bacteria or a virus. Meningitis is a serious infection of the brain and spinal cord. A test for lactate in cerebrospinal fluid is used with a lactic acid blood test to figure out the type of infection.1Why do I need a lactic acid test? You may need a lactic acid test if you have symptoms of lactic acidosis. These include: Nausea and vomiting Muscle weakness Sweating Shortness of breath Abdominal pain You may also need this test if you have symptoms of sepsis or meningitis. Symptoms of sepsis include: Fever Chills Rapid heart rate Rapid breathing Confusion Symptoms of meningitis include: Severe headache Fever Stiff neck Sensitivity to light1What happens during a lactic acid test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein or an artery. To take a sample from a vein, the health care professional will insert a small needle into your arm. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Make sure you don't clench your fist during the test, as this can temporarily raise lactic acid levels. Blood from an artery has more oxygen than blood from a vein, so your health care provider may recommend this type of blood test. The sample is usually taken from an artery inside the wrist. During the procedure, your provider will insert a needle with a syringe into the artery. You may feel a sharp pain as the needle goes into the artery. Once the syringe is filled with blood, your provider will put a bandage over the puncture site. After the procedure, you or a provider will need to apply firm pressure to the site for 5–10 minutes, or even longer if you are taking a blood-thinning medicine. If meningitis is suspected, your provider may order a test called a spinal tap or lumbar puncture to get a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your health care provider may tell you to not exercise for several hours before the test. Exercise can cause a temporary increase in lactic acid levels.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. A blood test from an artery is more painful than a blood test from a vein, but this pain usually goes away quickly. You may have some bleeding, bruising, or soreness at the spot where the needle was put in. Though problems are rare, you should avoid lifting heavy objects for 24 hours after the test.1What do the results mean? A high lactic acid level means you likely have lactic acidosis. There are two types of lactic acidosis: type A and type B. The cause of your lactic acidosis depends on which type you have. Type A is the most common form of the disorder. Conditions that cause type A lactic acidosis include: Sepsis Shock Heart failure Lung disease Anemia Type B lactic acidosis may be caused by one of the following conditions: Liver disease Leukemia Kidney disease Strenuous exercise If you had a spinal tap to check for a meningitis infection, your results may show: High levels of lactic acid. This probably means you have bacterial meningitis. Normal or slightly high levels of lactic acid. This probably means you have a viral form of the infection. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a lactic test? Certain medicines cause the body to make too much lactic acid. These include some treatments for HIV and a medicine for type 2 diabetes called metformin. If you are taking any of these medicines, you may be at a higher risk for lactic acidosis. Talk to your health care provider if you are concerned about any medicines you are taking.1References AIDSinfo [Internet].

Lactose tolerance tests measure your body's ability to break down lactose. Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk, cheese, ice cream, and other dairy products. Normally, an enzyme called lactase breaks down lactose into simpler sugars. These sugars are absorbed by the body and turned into energy. If your body doesn't make enough lactase, you won't be able to properly digest foods that contain lactose. This is known as lactose intolerance. There are two types of lactose tolerance tests: Hydrogen breath test. This test measures the amount of hydrogen gas in your breath before and after you drink a liquid containing lactose. It is the most common way to test for lactose intolerance. Glucose blood test. This test involves a series of blood tests that measure the level of glucose (a type of sugar) in your blood before and after you drink a liquid containing lactose. Other names: hydrogen breath test, oral lactose tolerance, lactose tolerance serum test, lactose intolerance test1What are they used for? Lactose tolerance tests are used to help diagnose lactose intolerance.1Why do I need a lactose tolerance test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of lactose intolerance. Symptoms usually happen within a half hour to two hours of eating or drinking dairy products. They include: Diarrhea Abdominal pain Bloating Gas Nausea1What happens during a lactose tolerance test? Your provider may order a hydrogen breath test or a glucose blood test. During a hydrogen breath test: You will breathe into a balloon-type container that measures the amount of hydrogen in your breath. You will drink a flavored liquid that contains lactose. You will breathe into the container again 30 minutes later, and every 30 minutes after that for three to four hours. Your hydrogen levels will be measured each time. During a glucose blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You will drink a liquid that contains lactose. More blood samples will be taken at specific time intervals, usually at 30 minutes, one hour, and two hours.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? To prepare for either type of test, you will need to: Fast (not eat or drink) for eight to 12 hours before the test Stop taking antibiotics for two to four weeks before the test Not smoke or exercise strenuously the day before the test If you are having a breath test, you may need to brush your teeth or rinse out your mouth shortly before the test.1Are there any risks to this test? If you are lactose intolerant, you may feel some cramps or bloating after drinking the lactose beverage. There are no other risks to having a hydrogen breath test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you had a hydrogen breath test, your results may show: An increased level of hydrogen after drinking lactose. This probably means you have lactose intolerance.  Little or no increase in hydrogen after drinking lactose. This means your symptoms are probably not caused by lactose intolerance. You may need more tests to figure out the cause of your symptoms. If you had a glucose blood test, your results may show: Your glucose levels did not increase after drinking lactose. This probably means you have lactose intolerance. Your glucose levels increased. This means your symptoms are probably not caused by lactose intolerance. You may need more tests to figure out the cause of your symptoms. If you are diagnosed with lactose intolerance, you should be able to manage your condition by limiting or avoiding foods with lactose, such as milk and cheese. Some people with lactose intolerance can have a limited amount of dairy without symptoms. Other people may need to completely avoid lactose. Taking a supplement that contains lactase may also help manage your condition. Be sure to talk to your health care provider about planning your diet and/or taking lactase supplements. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about lactose tolerance tests? Lactose intolerance is not the same thing as an allergy to milk or dairy. An allergy is an immune system response and can cause severe symptoms. While lactose intolerance does not cause serious complications, it can lead to uncomfortable and unpleasant symptoms. Adjusting your diet may help you avoid this discomfort.1References Kids Health from Nemours [Internet]. Jacksonville (FL): The Nemours Foundation; c1995–2021.

A laparoscopy is a type of surgery that lets a surgeon look inside your body without making a large incision (cut). It's used to help diagnose and sometimes treat conditions that develop in your belly or pelvis. To do a laparoscopy, a surgeon makes a small cut near your belly button that's usually a half-inch long or less. The surgeon inserts a long, thin tube with a camera through the cut and into your body. This tube is called a laparoscope. The camera sends images from inside your body to a video monitor. This allows the surgeon to see inside your body. The surgeon may make one or two other small cuts in your belly for inserting special surgical tools into your body. Using these tools, the surgeon can remove samples of tissue to check for signs of disease (a biopsy). Sometimes during a laparoscopy, the surgeon will use these tools to do procedures to treat certain problems. For example, if a laparoscopy finds a tumor, the surgeon may remove it completely during the same surgery. Many common surgical treatments can be done with laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopy is sometimes called "minimally invasive surgery" or "keyhole surgery," because it requires smaller cuts than traditional, "open" surgery. The use of smaller cuts has several benefits, including: Shorter hospital stays Less pain Faster recovery and smaller scars Other names: diagnostic laparoscopy, exploratory laparoscopy1What is it used for? Laparoscopy is used to help diagnose the cause of symptoms in the belly or pelvis. It's usually done if imaging tests, such as x-rays, ultrasounds, and MRI scans, haven't provided enough information to confirm a diagnosis. The test is often used to help diagnose: Digestive diseases Urinary disorders Disorders in the female reproductive system, which includes the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes A surgeon uses laparoscopy to: Examine organs and glands to look for:

Abnormal growths, such as cysts and tumors (cancerous and not cancerous)
Scar tissue and adhesions
Bleeding
Infections

 Abnormal growths, such as cysts and tumors (cancerous and not cancerous) Scar tissue and adhesions Bleeding Infections Collect tissue samples to check for disease Find out if a known cancer has spread in the body1Why do I need a laparoscopy? There are many reasons why you may need a laparoscopy, including if: You have pain or other symptoms in your belly or pelvis and imaging tests haven't been able to find the cause. You've been in a serious accident or have been wounded and may have organ injuries. You have cancer and your health care provider needs to know if it has spread to other parts of your body. This information helps choose your treatment. You've had abnormal liver tests and your provider doesn't know why. If you're female, you may need a laparoscopy to: Find out what's causing problems getting pregnant Diagnose symptoms that may involve your reproductive organs, including:

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
Endometriosis
Ectopic pregnancy
Uterine fibroids
Ovarian cysts

 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts1What happens during a laparoscopy? Laparoscopy is usually done in a hospital or an outpatient clinic. In general, it includes these steps: You'll wear a hospital gown and lay on an operating table. Usually, you will have general anesthesia, which is medicine to make you sleep during the surgery. The medicine is injected into your bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) line that's inserted into a vein. You may also inhale a gas from a mask to make you sleep. To do the laparoscopy, the surgeon will:

Make a small cut near your belly button
Put carbon dioxide gas into your belly to open up space between your organs so it's easier to see them
Insert the laparoscope and small camera into your belly
Move the laparoscope to look at your organs and glands on a computer screen

 Make a small cut near your belly button Put carbon dioxide gas into your belly to open up space between your organs so it's easier to see them Insert the laparoscope and small camera into your belly Move the laparoscope to look at your organs and glands on a computer screen If you need to have a biopsy or another procedure, the surgeon may need to make more small cuts to insert surgical tools. When the surgeon is done, the tools and most of the gas will be removed from your body, and the small incisions will be closed and bandaged. After surgery, you will be moved to a recovery room. In most cases, you'll be able to go home after a few hours, but that depends on what procedures were done during the laparoscopy. Before you leave, you'll get information about what to expect over the next few days at home.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your provider will let you know how to prepare. Be sure to follow all the instructions. You will need to fast (not eat or drink) for a period of time before a laparoscopy. Ask your provider whether you should take your usual medicines and/or supplements. But don't stop taking any medicine without talking with your provider first. Plan to wear loose-fitting clothes because after the surgery, your belly may be bloated from the gas and a little sore. You're also likely to feel groggy, so you'll need to plan to have someone take you home.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have mild abdominal pain or discomfort for a few days after a laparoscopy. You may also have neck or shoulder pain. That's because the gas used in the surgery may irritate nerves in your belly that run through your shoulder. After a laparoscopy, serious problems are very uncommon. But they can include bleeding, infection, blood clots, damage to an organ or blood vessel, and problems from the medicine that made you sleep during the procedure.1What do the results mean? The results of a laparoscopy depend on the reason for doing the procedure. Your provider can explain what was found and what that information means for your health. In general, your provider will be able to make a very accurate diagnosis of your condition based on the information from a laparoscopy.

Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Legionella tests look for these bacteria in urine, sputum, or blood. Legionnaires' disease got its name in 1976 after a group of people attending an American Legion convention became ill with pneumonia. Legionella bacteria can also cause a milder, flu-like illness called Pontiac fever. Together, Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever are known as legionellosis. Legionella bacteria are found naturally in freshwater environments. But the bacteria can make people sick when it grows and spreads in man-made water systems. These include plumbing systems of large buildings, including hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, and cruise ships. The bacteria may then contaminate water sources, such as hot tubs, fountains, and air-conditioning systems. Legionellosis infections happen when people breathe in mist or small drops of water that contain the bacteria. The bacteria do not spread from person to person. But a disease outbreak can occur when many people are exposed to the same contaminated water source. Not everyone who is exposed to Legionella bacteria will get sick. You are more likely to develop an infection you are: Over the age of 50 A current or former smoker Have a chronic disease such as diabetes or kidney failure Have a weakened immune system due to a disease such as HIV/AIDS or cancer, or are taking medicines that suppress the immune system While Pontiac fever usually clears up on its own, Legionnaires' disease can be fatal if not treated. Most people will recover if promptly treated with antibiotics. Other names: Legionnaires' disease testing, Legionellosis testing1What are they used for? Legionella tests are used to find out whether you have Legionnaires' disease. Other lung diseases have symptoms similar to Legionnaires' disease. Getting the right diagnosis and treatment may help prevent life-threatening complications.1Why do I need a Legionella test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of Legionnaires' disease. Symptoms usually show up two to 10 days after exposure to Legionella bacteria and may include: Cough High fever Chills Headache Chest pain Shortness of breath Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea1What happens during a Legionella test? Legionella tests may be done in urine, sputum, or blood. During a urine test: You will need to use the "clean catch" method to ensure your sample is sterile. The clean catch method includes the following steps: Wash your hands. Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad. Start to urinate into the toilet. Move the collection container under your urine stream. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amount. Finish urinating into the toilet. Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider. Sputum is a thick type of mucus made in your lungs when you have an infection.  During a sputum test: A health care provider will ask you to breathe deeply and then cough deeply into a special cup. Your provider may tap you on the chest to help loosen sputum from your lungs. If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a salty mist that can help you cough more deeply. During a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a Legionella test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to providing a urine or sputum sample. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results were positive, it probably means you have Legionnaires' disease. If your results were negative, it may mean you have a different type of infection. It may also mean not enough Legionella bacteria were found in your sample. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about Legionella tests? Whether your results were positive or negative, your provider may do others tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw5693 Lipase Tests : 1What is a lipase test? Lipase is a type of digestive enzyme or "digestive juice." It helps your body digest fats.  Most of your lipase is made in your pancreas, an organ located behind the lower part of your stomach. Lipase is also made in your salivary (spit) glands and in your stomach. It's normal to have a small amount of lipase in your blood. But if the cells of your pancreas are damaged, they will release larger amounts of lipase. So high levels of lipase in your blood may mean you have pancreatitis, (an inflamed, swollen pancreas) or another type of pancreatic disease. A lipase tests can help diagnose these conditions and others. Other names: serum lipase, lipase, LPS1What is it used for? A lipase test may be used to: Help diagnose diseases of the pancreas, especially acute (sudden) pancreatitis Check to see if treatment for pancreatic diseases is working Help diagnose and monitor chronic diseases that affect the pancreas, including:

Cystic fibrosis
Crohn disease
Celiac disease

 Cystic fibrosis Crohn disease Celiac disease1Why do I need a lipase test? You may need a lipase test if you have symptoms that may be caused by a problem with your pancreas. These include: Pain in your upper belly that may spread to your back Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Swollen or tender belly Fever Fast heartbeat1What happens during a lipase test? Lipase is measured with a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 8-12 hours before a lipase blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A very high level of lipase is usually a sign of acute pancreatitis. Higher than normal levels of lipase may be caused by: Diseases of the pancreas, including a blocked duct (tube), or pancreatic cancer Chronic kidney disease Peptic ulcer Gallbladder disease Intestinal problems, such as a blocked intestine Diabetes Salivary (spit) gland disorders, such as infection or cancer Alcohol use disorder Low levels of lipase may be a sign of permanent damage to cells in your pancreas that make lipase. This may happen in certain chronic (long-lasting) diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. If your lipase levels are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many medicines, including codeine, diuretics ("water pills"), certain cholesterol medicines, and birth control pills, can affect your lipase levels. If you have questions about your lipase test results, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a lipase test? A lipase test is commonly used to diagnose pancreatitis. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis is a sudden, short-term condition can usually be cured with treatment. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-lasting condition that gets worse over time. But it can be managed with medicine and lifestyle changes, such as not drinking alcohol or smoking and being at a healthy weight. In certain cases, your provider may recommend surgery if other treatments don't help enough.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw7976 Lipoprotein (a) Blood Test : 1What is a Lipoprotein (a) Blood Test? A lipoprotein (a) test measures the level of lipoprotein (a) in your blood. A high level of lipoprotein (a) may mean you have a high risk for heart disease and stroke. Lipoproteins are particles made of protein and fats (lipids). They carry cholesterol through your bloodstream to your cells. The two main groups of lipoproteins are called HDL (high-density lipoprotein) or "good" cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or "bad" cholesterol. Lipoprotein (a) is a type of LDL. These lipoproteins carry cholesterol to the cells in your arteries. If you have high levels of LDL particles, cholesterol can build up in your arteries and form blockages called plaques. This condition is known as atherosclerosis or "hardening of the arteries." It can lead many serious medical conditions including: Coronary artery disease, narrow or blocked arteries in your heart Heart attack Stroke Peripheral arterial disease, blocked arteries in your legs or arms Other blood vessel diseases Lipoprotein (a) particles are stickier than other types of LDL particles, so they may be more likely to cause blockages and blood clots in your arteries. As a result, high levels of lipoprotein (a) may mean you have a very high risk for heart disease, stroke, and other serious conditions related to blockages and blood clots in your arteries. A lipoprotein (a) blood test can give you a more accurate understanding of your risk than a routine cholesterol test that only measures your total LDL cholesterol level. That's because a routine cholesterol test may show that your LDL cholesterol level is "healthy," but if a large percentage of your LDL cholesterol is carried by lipoprotein (a) particles, your risk for heart disease and stroke could still be high. Other names: cholesterol Lp(a), Lp(a)1What is it used for? A lipoprotein (a) test is used to get a better understanding of your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other blood vessel diseases. But it is not a routine screening test. Researchers are still studying how lipoprotein (a) levels affect health and when the test should be used.1Why do I need a lipoprotein (a) test? Your health care provider may order the test if you have certain signs or health conditions that mean you have a high risk for blockages in your arteries, such as: A family health history of early heart or blood vessel disease (before age 55 for a father or brother and before age 65 for a mother or sister) High LDL cholesterol, even though you take medicine to lower it Heart or blood vessel disease, especially if your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are normal without taking medicine to lower them Signs of an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolemia Had more than one heart attack or more than one procedure to open up narrow or blocked arteries in your heart (angioplasty) The test may also be used to help make decisions about the risks and benefits of taking cholesterol medicine to lower your chance of developing heart and blood vessel disease.1What happens during a lipoprotein (a) test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Preparations for a lipoprotein (a) test depend on the lab doing the test. Usually, you need to fast (not eat or drink) for 9 to 12 hours before your blood is drawn. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow. Certain substances can affect your test results. Before you get a lipoprotein (a) test, tell your provider if you have been drinking alcohol or taking niacin supplements, aspirin, or oral estrogen hormones.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A high lipoprotein (a) level may mean you have a high risk for heart and blood vessel disease, even if your cholesterol levels are normal and you are healthy. Lipoprotein (a) levels usually don't change much over time. But test results may be affected by certain health conditions. Talk with your provider about what your test results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a lipoprotein (a) test? Your genes control how much lipoprotein (a) you make. By age 5, you usually have your "adult level" of lipoprotein (a), and it tends to remain about the same for the rest of your life. For that reason, diet and exercise may not change your lipoprotein (a) levels. But if you have a high level of lipoprotein (a), it's very important to take steps to improve your heart health. This will help lower your overall risk for heart and blood vessel problems, even though it may not change your lipoprotein (a) levels. Your provider may suggest: Taking medicine to lower your LDL cholesterol if it is high Eating a healthy diet Losing weight Quitting smoking Getting regular exercise Reducing stress Lowering your blood pressure1References Amgen [Internet].

Available from: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31147269/ Liver Function Tests : 1What are liver function tests? Liver function tests (also known as a liver panel) are blood tests that measure different enzymes, proteins, and other substances made by the liver. These tests check the overall health of your liver. The different substances are often tested at the same time on a single blood sample, and may include the following: Albumin, a protein made in the liver Total protein. This test measures the total amount of protein in the blood. ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and gamma-glutamyl tansferase (GGT). These are different enzymes made by the liver. Bilirubin, a waste product made by the liver. Lactate dehydrogenase (LD), an enzyme found in most of the body's cells. LD is released into the blood when cells have been damaged by disease or injury. Prothrombin time (PT), a protein involved in blood clotting. If levels of one or more of these substances are outside of the normal range, it may be a sign of liver disease. Other names: liver panel, liver function panel, liver profile hepatic function panel, LFT1What are they used for? Liver function tests are most often used to: Help diagnose liver diseases, such as hepatitis Monitor treatment of liver disease. These tests can show how well the treatment is working. Check how badly a liver has been damaged or scarred by disease, such as cirrhosis Monitor side effects of certain medicines1Why do I need liver function testing? You may need liver function testing if you have symptoms of liver disease. These include: Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal pain Dark-colored urine Light-colored stool Fatigue You may also need these tests if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk for liver disease if you: Have a family history of liver disease Have alcohol use disorder, a condition in which you have difficulty controlling how much you drink Think you have been exposed to a hepatitis virus Take medicines that may cause liver damage1What happens during a liver function test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 10-12 hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If one or more of your liver function test results were not normal, it may mean your liver is damaged or not working properly. Liver damage can be caused by a number of different conditions, including: Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Alcohol use disorder, which includes alcoholism. Liver cancer Diabetes If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about liver function tests? If any of your liver function tests were not normal, your provider may need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis. These tests may include more blood tests and/or a liver biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue for testing.1References Cleveland Clinic [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c2019.

Lung cancer tumor markers are substances produced by tumor cells. Normal cells can turn into tumor cells due to a genetic mutation, a change in the normal function of genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father. Some genetic mutations can be inherited from your parents. Others are acquired later in life due to environmental or lifestyle factors. The mutations that cause lung cancer are usually due to acquired, also known as somatic, mutations. These mutations are most often, though not always caused by a history of tobacco smoking. A genetic mutation can cause a lung tumor to spread and grow into cancer. There are different types of mutations that cause lung cancer. A lung cancer tumor marker test looks for the specific mutation that may be causing your cancer. The most commonly tested lung cancer markers include mutations in the following genes: EGFR, which makes a protein involved in cell division KRAS, which helps control the growth of tumors ALK, which is involved in cell growth Not all lung cancers are caused by genetic mutations. But if your cancer is caused by a mutation, you may be able to take a medicine that's designed to attack your specific type of mutated cancer cells. This is called targeted therapy. Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel1What are they used for? Tests for lung cancer tumor markers are most often used to find out which, if any, genetic mutation is causing your lung cancer. Lung cancer markers may be tested individually or grouped together in one test.1Why do I need a lung cancer tumor marker test? You may need a lung cancer tumor marker test if you have been diagnosed with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer. This type of cancer is more likely to have a genetic mutation that will respond to targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is often more effective and causes fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation. But it's important to know which mutation you have. Targeted therapy medicines that are effective in someone with one type of mutation, might not work or may be dangerous to someone with a different mutation or no mutation.1What happens during a lung cancer tumor marker test? A health care provider will need to take a small sample of the tumor in a procedure called a biopsy. It may be one of two types of biopsies: Fine needle aspiration biopsy, which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of  cells or fluid Core needle biopsy, which uses a larger needle to remove a sample Fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies usually include the following steps: You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table. An x-ray or other imaging device may be used to locate the desired biopsy site. The skin will be marked. A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Once the area is numb, the provider will make a small incision (cut) and insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the lung. Then he or she will remove a sample of tissue from the biopsy site. You may feel a little pressure when the needle enters the lung. Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops. Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the procedure. Talk to your health care provider if you have any questions about preparing for your test.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have a little discomfort at the site for a day or two.1What do the results mean? If your results show you have one of the lung cancer markers that may respond well to targeted therapy, your provider may start you on treatment right away. If your results show you do not have one of these lung cancer markers, you and your provider may discuss other treatment options. Genetic testing takes longer than many other types of lab tests. You may not get your results for a few weeks. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about lung cancer tumor marker tests? If you have lung cancer, it's important to see your health care provider regularly throughout your treatment and afterward. Lung cancer can be difficult to treat, even if you are on targeted therapy. Close monitoring with frequent checkups, and periodic x-rays and scans is recommended for the first five years after treatment, and yearly for the rest of your life.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Lung function tests, also known as pulmonary function tests, or PFTs, are a group of tests that check to see if your lungs are working right. The tests look for: How much air your lungs can hold How well you move air in and out of your lungs How well the lungs move oxygen into your bloodstream. Your blood cells need oxygen to grow and stay healthy. There are several types of lung function tests. They include: Spirometry. the most common type of lung function test. It measures how much and how quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs. Lung volume test. also known as body plethysmography. This test measures the amount of air you can hold in your lungs and the amount of air that remains after you exhale (breathe out) as much as you can. Gas diffusion test. This test measures how oxygen and other gases move from the lungs to the bloodstream. Exercise stress test. This test looks at how exercise affects lung function. These tests may be used together or by themselves, depending on your specific symptoms or condition. Other names: pulmonary function tests, PFTs1What are they used for? Lung function tests are often used to: Find the cause of breathing problems Diagnose and monitor chronic lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema See if lung disease treatments are working Check lung function before surgery Check whether exposure to chemicals or other substances in the home or workplace have caused lung damage1Why do I need a lung function test? You may need this test if you: Have symptoms of a breathing problem such as shortness of breath, wheezing, and/or coughing Have a chronic lung disease Have been exposed to asbestos or other substances known to cause lung damage Have scleroderma, a disease that damages connective tissue Have sarcoidosis, a disease that causes damage to cells around the lungs, liver, and other organs Have a respiratory infection Had an abnormal chest x-ray Are scheduled for an operation such as abdominal or lung surgery1What happens during lung function testing? Below are the steps for the most common types of lung function tests. For a spirometry test: You'll sit in a chair and a soft clip will be put on your nose. This is done so you'll breathe through your mouth, rather than your nose. You'll be given a mouthpiece that is attached to a machine called a spirometer. You'll place your lips tightly around the mouthpiece, and breathe in and out as instructed by your provider. The spirometer will measure the amount and rate of air flow over a period of time. For a lung volume (body plethysmography) test: You'll sit in a clear, airtight room that looks like a telephone booth. As with a spirometry test, you'll wear a nose clip and place your lips around a mouthpiece connected to a machine. You'll breathe in and breathe out as instructed by your provider. The pressure changes inside the room help measure lung volume. For a gas diffusion test: You'll wear a mouthpiece connected to a machine. You will be asked to inhale (breathe in) a very small, nondangerous amount of carbon monoxide or other type of gas. Measurements will either be taken as you breathe in or as you breathe out. The test can show how effective your lungs are in moving gases to your bloodstream. For an exercise test, you will: Ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill. You'll be attached to monitors and machines that will measure blood oxygen, blood pressure, and heartbeat. This helps show how well your lungs perform during exercise.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the tests? To prepare for a lung function test, you'll need to take some steps to ensure your breathing is normal and unrestricted. These include: Don't eat a heavy meal before the test. Avoid food or drinks with caffeine. Don't smoke or do heavy exercise for six hours before the test. Wear loose, comfortable clothing. If you wear dentures, you'll need to wear them during the test. They can help you form a tight seal around the mouthpiece.1Are there any risks to the tests? There is very little risk to having a lung function test. Some people may feel lightheaded or dizzy during the procedure. Also, some people may feel claustrophobic during a lung volume test. If you have questions or concerns about the tests, talk to your health care provider.1What do the results mean? If any of your lung function test results were not normal, it may mean you have a lung disease. There are two main types of lung diseases that can be diagnosed with a lung function test: Obstructive diseases. These diseases cause airways to become narrow, making it hard for air to flow out of the lungs. Obstructive lung diseases include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Restrictive diseases. In these diseases, the lungs or chest muscles aren't able to expand enough. This reduces air flow and the ability to send oxygen into the bloodstream. Restrictive lung disorders include scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about lung function tests? In addition to your lung function tests, your health care provider may order a blood oxygen level test.  It's also known as an arterial blood gases (ABGs) test. This test measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood.1References American Lung Association [Internet]. Chicago: American Lung Association; c2019.

This test measures the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your blood. LH is made by your pituitary gland, a small gland located underneath the brain. LH plays an important role in sexual development and functioning. In women, LH helps control the menstrual cycle. It also triggers the release of an egg from the ovary. This is known as ovulation. LH levels quickly rise just before ovulation. In men, LH causes the testicles to make testosterone, which is important for producing sperm. Normally, LH levels in men do not change very much. In children, LH levels are usually low in early childhood, and begin to rise a couple of years before the start of puberty. In girls, LH helps signal the ovaries to make estrogen. In boys, it helps signal the testes to make testosterone. Too much or too little LH can cause a variety of problems, including infertility (the inability to get pregnant), menstrual difficulties in women, low sex drive in men, and early or delayed puberty in children. Other names: lutropin, interstitial cell stimulating hormone1What is it used for? An LH test works closely with another hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to control sexual functions. So an FSH test is often done along with an LH test. These tests are used in different ways, depending on whether you are a woman, man, or child. In women, these tests are most often used to: Help find the cause of infertility Find out when ovulation occurs, this is the time when you are most likely to get pregnant. Find the reason for irregular or stopped menstrual periods. Confirm the start of menopause, or perimenopause. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old. Perimenopause is the transition period before menopause. It can last for several years. LH testing may be done towards the end of this transition. In men, these tests are most often used to: Help find the cause of infertility Find the reason for a low sperm count Find the reason for low sex drive In children, these tests are most often used to help diagnose early or delayed puberty. Puberty is considered early if it starts before age 9 in girls and before age 10 in boys. Puberty is considered delayed if hasn't started by age 13 in girls and by age 14 in boys.1Why do I need an LH test? If you are a woman, you may need this test if: You've been unable to get pregnant after 12 months of trying. Your menstrual cycle is irregular. Your periods have stopped. The test may be used to find out if you have gone through menopause or are in perimenopause. If you are a man, you may need this test if: You've been unable to get your partner pregnant after 12 months of trying. Your sex drive is decreased. Both men and women may need testing if they have symptoms of a pituitary disorder. These include some of the symptoms listed above, as well as: Fatigue Weakness Weight loss Decreased appetite Your child may need an LH test if he or she is does not seem to be starting puberty at the right age (either too early or too late).1What happens during an LH levels test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you are a woman that has not gone through menopause, your provider may want to schedule your test at a specific time during your menstrual cycle.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The meaning of your results will depend on whether you are a woman, man, or child. If you are woman, high LH levels may mean you: Are not ovulating. If you are of childbearing age, this may mean you have a problem in your ovaries. If you are older, it may mean you have started menopause or are in perimenopause. Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormone disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility. Have Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder affects sexual development in females. It often causes infertility. If you are woman, low LH levels may mean: Your pituitary gland is not working correctly. You have an eating disorder. You have malnutrition. If you are a man, high LH levels may mean: Your testicles have been damaged due to chemotherapy, radiation, infection, or alcohol abuse. You have Klinefelter's syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects sexual development in males. It often causes infertility If you are a man, low LH levels may mean you have a disorder of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls the pituitary gland and other important body functions. In children, high LH levels, along with high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, may mean puberty is about to start or has already started. If this is happening before age 9 in a girl or before age 10 in a boy (precocious puberty), it may be a sign of: A disorder of the central nervous systems A brain injury Low LH and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in children may mean be a sign of delayed puberty. Delayed puberty may be caused by: A disorder of the ovaries or testicles Turner syndrome in girls Klinefelter's syndrome in boys An infection A hormone deficiency An eating disorder If you have questions about your results or child's results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an LH test? There is an at-home test that measures LH levels in urine. The kit is designed to detect the rise in LH that happens just before ovulation. This test may help you figure out when you will be ovulating and have the best chances of getting pregnant. But you should not use this test to prevent pregnancy. It is not reliable for that purpose.1References FDA: US Food and Drug Administration [Internet].

Lyme disease is an infection caused by bacteria you get from tick bites. Lyme disease tests look for signs of infection in a sample of your blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear liquid that flows in and around your brain and spinal cord. The test checks your sample for antibodies that your immune system makes to fight the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. You can get Lyme disease if an infected tick bites you. Ticks can bite you anywhere on your body, but they usually bite in hard-to-see places such as your groin, scalp, backs of the knees, and armpits. Most Lyme disease is caused by bites from tiny, baby ticks that are no bigger than a pinhead. So you may not know you have been bitten. In general, an infected tick needs to be attached to you for 36 to 48 hours before it can give you Lyme disease bacteria. Without treatment, Lyme disease can cause serious health problems that may affect your joints, heart, and nervous system. But if you find Lyme disease early, it can usually be cured after a few weeks of treatment with antibiotic medicine. If it's found later, treatment may take up to eight weeks. Other names: Lyme antibodies detection, Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies test, Borrelia DNA Detection, IgM/IgG by Western Blot, Lyme disease test (CSF), Borrelia antibodies, IgM/IgG1What are they used for? Lyme disease tests are used to find out if you have a Lyme disease infection. Your health provider is most likely to order the test if you have symptoms that could be Lyme disease, and you have or could have been exposed to infected ticks. In the United States, infected ticks are most commonly found in states in the: Northeast Mid-Atlantic Upper Midwest Pacific coast, especially northern California1Why do I need a Lyme disease test? You may need a test if you have symptoms of infection and were exposed or possibly exposed to ticks that carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The first symptoms of Lyme disease usually show up between 3 and 30 days after the tick bite. Early signs and symptoms may include: A reddish round skin rash that slowly gets bigger over several days. It usually doesn't itch or hurt, but it may be warm. As it gets better, it may look like a bull's-eye (a red ring with a clear center), but not always. Fever Chills Headache Fatigue Muscle and joint aches Swollen lymph nodes ("swollen glands") Later signs and symptoms of Lyme disease usually affect your joints and nervous system. They include: Severe headaches and neck stiffness Rashes on other parts of your body Facial palsy (drooping of one or both sides of your face) Arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, especially in the knees Pain that comes and goes in your muscles, joints, bones, and tendons Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Periods of feeling dizzy or short of breath Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in your hands or feet1What happens during Lyme disease testing? Lyme disease testing is usually done on a sample of blood. In certain cases, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test may be done. For a Lyme disease blood test:

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
 For a CSF test:

You may need a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test if your symptoms could mean that Lyme disease is affecting your nervous system, such as a stiff neck or numb hands or feet. Providers may order a CSF test if the results of your blood test show you likely have Lyme disease or if the results are uncertain.
 To get a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid, a provider will do a procedure called a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. During the procedure: You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table. A provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection. When the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine. Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes. You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn. Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a Lyme disease blood test. For a lumbar puncture, you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.1Are there any risks to Lyme disease tests? There is very little risk to having a blood test or a lumbar puncture. With a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. With a CSF test, you may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back where the needle was inserted. You may also have some bleeding at the site or get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more, but your provider may suggest treatment to help relieve the pain.1What do the results mean? Lyme disease is difficult to diagnose. The symptoms are common to many conditions, and test results alone can't diagnose the disease. To make a diagnosis, your provider will consider your test results along with your medical history, exposure, and symptoms. You may also need other tests. A negative blood test result means that antibodies to fight the Lyme disease bacteria were not found in your blood. If you had symptoms for longer than 30 days before your test, you probably don't have Lyme disease. But if you had symptoms for less than 30 days before you gave your blood sample, you may need to have another Lyme disease test. That's because it may take a few weeks for your body to make enough antibodies to show up on a test. If your test was done too soon, you could be infected even though your test was negative. This is called a "false negative." A positive blood test result means that antibodies to fight the Lyme disease bacteria were found in your blood. In this case, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a second blood test on the same blood sample. If the second test is positive and you have symptoms of infection, you probably have Lyme disease. But positive test results don't always mean that Lyme disease is causing your symptoms. You could have antibodies from a past case of Lyme disease that your body successfully fought off months or even years ago. It's also possible to have a "false positive." That means you don't have antibodies that fight Lyme disease bacteria, even though the test says you do. The test may have mistakenly found antibodies that fight other bacteria or diseases, such as certain autoimmune diseases. And it's possible that these diseases are causing your symptoms, not Lyme disease. The results from a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test can help show whether Lyme disease has spread to your nervous system. A negative CSF test result means that no Lyme disease antibodies were found in your cerebrospinal fluid. But it doesn't rule out Lyme disease in your nervous system. You may need more tests. A positive CSF test result means that Lyme disease antibodies were found in your cerebrospinal fluid. If more antibodies were in your cerebrospinal fluid than in your blood, it's possible that Lyme Disease has spread to your nervous system. Your provider will prescribe antibiotic medicine if you are likely to have Lyme disease. Most people who are treated with antibiotics in the early stage of disease will recover completely. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about Lyme disease tests? At-home test kits for Lyme disease are available. To do these tests, you usually collect a drop of blood from your finger and send it to a lab for testing. If you want to do an at-home test, it's important to talk with your provider first. Some at-home tests may use lab methods that aren't proven to work, so your results may not be accurate.1References ALDF: American Lyme Disease Foundation [Internet].

A magnesium blood test measures the amount of magnesium in your blood. Magnesium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that are responsible for many important functions and processes in your body. Your body needs magnesium to help your muscles, nerves, and heart work properly. Magnesium also helps control blood pressure and blood sugar. Most of your body's magnesium is in your bones and cells. But a small amount is found in your blood. Magnesium levels in the blood that are too low or too high can be a sign of a serious health problem. Other names: Mg, Mag, Magnesium-Serum1What is it used for? A magnesium blood test is used to check the level of magnesium in your blood. Levels that are too low are known as hypomagnesemia or magnesium deficiency. This is more common than levels that are too high, which is called hypermagnesemia. A magnesium blood test is also sometimes included with tests of other electrolytes, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, and chloride.1Why do I need a magnesium blood test? Your health care provider may order a magnesium blood test if you have symptoms of low magnesium or high magnesium levels. Symptoms of low magnesium include: Weakness Muscle cramps and/or twitching Confusion Irregular heartbeat Seizures (in severe cases) Symptoms of high magnesium include: Muscle weakness Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Trouble breathing Cardiac arrest, the sudden stopping of the heart (in severe cases) You may also need this test if you are pregnant. A magnesium deficiency can be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious form of high blood pressure that affects pregnant women. In addition, your provider may order this test if you have a health problem that can cause a magnesium deficiency. These include malnutrition, alcoholism, and diabetes.1What happens during a magnesium blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Certain medicines can affect magnesium levels. Tell your health care provider about any prescription and over-the-counter medicines you are taking. Your provider will let you know if you need to stop taking them for a few days before your test. You'll also need to stop taking magnesium supplements before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show you have a magnesium deficiency, it may be a sign of: Alcoholism Malnutrition Preeclampsia (if you are pregnant) Chronic diarrhea Digestive disorder, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Diabetes If your results show you have a higher than normal amount of magnesium, it may be a sign of: Addison disease, a disorder of the adrenal glands Kidney disease Dehydration, the loss of too much bodily fluids Diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication of diabetes Overuse of antacids or laxatives that contain magnesium If your results show you have a magnesium deficiency, your health care provider will probably recommend you take magnesium supplements to raise levels of the mineral. If your results show you have too much magnesium, your provider may recommend IV therapies (medicine delivered directly to your veins) that can remove excess magnesium. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a magnesium blood test? Your health care provider may order a magnesium in urine test, in addition to a magnesium blood test.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

Parasites are tiny plants or animals that get nutrients by living off another creature. Parasites that cause malaria are passed to humans through the bite of infected mosquitos. At first, malaria symptoms may be similar to those of the flu. Later on, malaria can lead to life-threatening complications. Malaria is not contagious like a cold or flu, but it can be spread from person to person by mosquitos. If a mosquito bites an infected person, it will spread the parasite to anyone it bites afterward. If you are bitten by an infected mosquito, the parasites will travel into your bloodstream. The parasites will multiply inside your red blood cells and cause illness. Malaria tests look for signs of a malaria infection in the blood. Malaria is common in tropical and subtropical areas. Every year, millions of people are infected with malaria, and hundreds of thousands of people die from the disease. Most people who die from malaria are young children in Africa. While malaria is found in more than 87 countries, most infections and deaths happen in Africa. Malaria is rare in the United States. But U.S. citizens who travel to Africa and other tropical countries are at risk for getting infected. Other names: malaria blood smear, malaria rapid diagnostic test, malaria by PCR1What are they used for? Malaria tests are used to diagnose malaria. If malaria is diagnosed and treated early, it can usually be cured. Left untreated, malaria can lead to life-threatening complications, including kidney failure, liver failure, and internal bleeding.1Why do I need a malaria test? You may need this test if you live or have recently traveled to an area where malaria is common and you have symptoms of malaria. Most people will have symptoms within 14 days of being bitten by an infected mosquito. But symptoms can show up as soon as seven days afterward or can take as long as a year to appear. In the early stages of infection, malaria symptoms are similar to the flu, and may include: Fever Chills Fatigue Headache Body aches Nausea and vomiting In the later stages of infection, symptoms are more serious and may include: High fever Shivering and chills Convulsions Bloody stools Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) Seizures Mental confusion1What happens during a malaria test? Your health care provider will probably ask about your symptoms and for details on your recent travels. If an infection is suspected, your blood will be tested to check for signs of a malaria infection. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Your blood sample may be tested in one or both of the following ways. Blood smear test. In a blood smear, a drop of blood is put on a specially treated slide. A laboratory professional will examine the slide under a microscope and look for parasites. Rapid diagnostic test. This test looks for proteins known as antigens, which are released by malaria parasites. It can provide faster results than a blood smear, but a blood smear is usually needed to confirm a diagnosis.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for a malaria test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results were negative, but you still have malaria symptoms, you may need retesting. The number of malaria parasites can vary at times. So your provider may order blood smears every 12-24 hours over a period of two to three days. It's important to find out whether you have malaria so you can get treated quickly. If your results were positive, your health care provider will prescribe medicine to treat the disease. The type of medicine will depend on your age, how serious your malaria symptoms are, and whether you are pregnant. When treated early, most cases of malaria can be cured. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about malaria tests? If you will be traveling to an area where malaria is common, talk to your health care provider before you go. He or she may prescribe a medicine that can help prevent malaria. There are also steps you can take to prevent mosquito bites. This may reduce your risk of getting malaria and other infections transmitted by mosquitos. To prevent bites, you should: Apply an insect repellent containing DEET on your skin and clothing. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants. Use screens on windows and doors. Sleep under a mosquito net.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume. An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. If your red blood cells are too small or too large, it could be a sign of a blood disorder such as anemia, a lack of certain vitamins, or other medical conditions. Other names: CBC with differential1What is it used for? An MCV blood test is often part of a complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a common blood test that measures many parts of your blood, including red blood cells. It is used to check your general health. An MCV test may also be used with other tests to help diagnose or monitor certain blood disorders, including anemia. There are many types of anemia. An MCV test can help diagnose which type of anemia you have.1Why do I need an MCV blood test? Your health care provider may order a complete blood count, which includes an MCV test, as part of your regular checkup. You may also have the test if you have a chronic (long-lasting) condition that could lead to anemia or if you have the symptoms of anemia: Shortness of breath Weakness or fatigue Headache Dizziness Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)1What happens during an MCV blood test? During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an MCV blood test. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? An MCV test alone cannot diagnose any disease. Your provider will use the results of your MCV, other test results, and your medical history to make a diagnosis. If your results show that your red blood cells are smaller than normal, it may be a sign of: Certain types of anemia, including iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type Thalassemia, an uncommon genetic condition If your results show that your red blood cells are larger than normal, it may be a sign of: Pernicious anemia, which may be caused by:

A lack of vitamin B12
A disease that affects your body's ability to use vitamin B12, such as certain autoimmune diseases, celiac disease, or Crohn's disease.

 A lack of vitamin B12 A disease that affects your body's ability to use vitamin B12, such as certain autoimmune diseases, celiac disease, or Crohn's disease. Anemia caused by a lack of folic acid Liver disease It's also possible to have anemia with a normal MCV. This may happen if anemia is caused by conditions, such as: A sudden loss of blood Kidney failure Aplastic anemia (uncommon) If your MCV levels are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Diet, activity level, medicines, a menstrual period, and other conditions can affect the test results. Talk with your health care provider to learn what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an MCV blood test? If your provider thinks you may have anemia or another blood disorder, you may have other red blood cell tests with an MCV. These tests may include a red blood cell count and measurements of hemoglobin. All together, these tests are called red blood cell indices.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

Measles and mumps are infections caused by similar viruses. There are different types of measles and mumps tests. These tests can: Diagnose an infection you (or your child) have now or recently had Show whether you are immune (protected against infection) to measles and mumps because you had a vaccination or a past infection. Measles and mumps are both very contagious, which means that they easily spread from person to person: Measles causes symptoms like a bad cold or the flu. It also causes a flat, red rash. The rash usually starts on your face and spreads all over your body. Mumps causes symptoms like the flu with painful swelling of the salivary (spit) glands, which makes your cheeks and jaw puffy. In general, mumps is a milder disease than measles. Most healthy people with measles or mumps infections will get better in about two weeks or less. But sometimes these infections cause serious complications, such as encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Measles may also cause pneumonia and serious problems during pregnancy. In the United States, most people have been vaccinated against measles and mumps. As a result, measles has become a rare disease in this country. Most cases of measles come from unvaccinated people who have traveled to countries where measles is common and returned home with the disease. Outbreaks of mumps still happen in the U.S., mainly in group living situations, such as colleges. Some people who have been vaccinated may still get mumps during an outbreak, but they will usually have mild symptoms. Other names: measles immunity test, mumps immunity test, measles blood test, mumps blood test, measles viral culture, measles viral culture, measles virus by RT-PCR, mumps virus by RT-PCR, measles antibody IgM, IgG, mumps antibody IgM, IgG1What are the tests used for? Measles testing and mumps testing can be used to: Diagnose an active infection of measles or mumps. An active infection means you have  a virus growing in your body now. Two types of tests are used to diagnose measles and mumps:

IgM antibody test. IgM antibodies are proteins your immune system makes when the measles or mumps virus is in your body. The test looks for IgM antibodies in a sample of your blood.
Molecular tests. These tests look for the measles or mumps virus in a sample of your blood, fluid from your nose or throat, or urine. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is a common type of molecular test.

 IgM antibody test. IgM antibodies are proteins your immune system makes when the measles or mumps virus is in your body. The test looks for IgM antibodies in a sample of your blood. Molecular tests. These tests look for the measles or mumps virus in a sample of your blood, fluid from your nose or throat, or urine. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is a common type of molecular test. Find out whether you are immune to measles or mumps. If you had a vaccination for measles and mumps or were sick with either virus in the past, your body makes IgG antibodies to protect you against future infection, usually for the rest of your life. An IgG antibody test checks for these antibodies in your blood. Help find and control outbreaks of measles and mumps in the community. Tests help find new and recent cases of measles and mumps so that public health officials can take steps to help stop the disease from spreading. An MMR antibody screening is a single blood test that is used to help diagnose both measles and mumps or to see if you are immune. MMR stands for measles, mumps, and rubella. Rubella, also known as German measles, is caused by another type of virus.1Why do I need a measles or mumps test? You may need a test to check your immunity to measles and mumps if you: Are pregnant or planning to become pregnant Are going to attend a school or start a job that requires proof that you are immune Are a health care worker who may be exposed to people with measles or mumps Your health care provider may order a measles or mumps test if you or your child has symptoms of measles or mumps. Symptoms of measles include: Rash that starts on the face and spreads to the chest and legs High fever Cough Runny nose Sore throat Pink eye (also called conjunctivitis) Tiny white spots in the mouth Symptoms of mumps include: Swollen, painful jaw and puffy cheeks Headache Earache Fever Muscle aches Loss of appetite Painful swallowing1What happens during measles and mumps tests? There are different ways to test for measles and mumps. Antibody tests require a blood sample. Molecular tests often use a sample of blood or fluid from your mouth, throat, or nose: Blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Swab test. A health care professional will use a special swab to take a sample from your nose, throat, or cheek. Nasal aspirate or wash. A health care professional will insert a saline solution (salt water) into your nose and remove the sample with gentle suction. If your provider thinks you have measles or mumps, you may have more than one test. Also, if your provider thinks measles or mumps has caused encephalitis or meningitis, you may need a spinal tap. For a spinal tap, your health care provider will insert a thin, hollow needle into your spine and withdraw a small amount of fluid for testing.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests? You don't need any special preparations for measles testing or mumps testing.1Are there any risks to these tests?  There is very little risk to measles or mumps testing. A blood test may cause slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. A swab test may cause a gagging feeling or even a tickle when your throat or nose is swabbed. A nasal aspirate or wash may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.1What do the results mean? Negative test results mean that no signs of measles or mumps were found in your sample. This usually means that you don't have measles or mumps now. If you had a negative result on an antibody test, it also means that you are not immune to measles or mumps. Positive test results mean different things depending on which test you had: A positive result on a molecular test (PCR) means that the measles or mumps virus was found in your blood, and you have an infection now. A positive result on an IgM antibody test means you have a measles or mumps infection now or you had a recent infection. A positive result on an IgG antibody test means you are immune to measles or mumps because you had a vaccination or past infection. Talk with your provider if you have questions about test results. If you (or your child) have a measles or mumps infection, you should stay home for several days to recover and to make sure you don't spread the disease. Your provider will let you know when it will be okay to return to your regular activities. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about measles and mumps tests? Vaccination is the best protection against measles and mumps and their complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends: For children: Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine given:

Between 12 and 15 months.
Between ages four and six.

 Between 12 and 15 months. Between ages four and six. For adults who aren't immune to measles and mumps and aren't pregnant: At least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Some people may need two doses. If you're not sure whether you're immune to measles and mumps, or if you have questions about vaccine safety, talk with your provider.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw180629 Measuring Blood Pressure : 1What is a blood pressure measurement? Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries. A blood pressure measurement is a test that measures the force (pressure) in your arteries as your heart pumps. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers: Systolic blood pressure (the first and higher number) measures pressure inside your arteries when the heart beats. Diastolic blood pressure (the second and lower number) measures the pressure inside the artery when the heart rests between beats. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, affects tens of millions of adults in the United States. It increases the risk of life-threatening conditions including heart attack and stroke. But high blood pressure rarely causes symptoms. A blood pressure measurement helps diagnose high blood pressure early, so it may be treated before it leads to serious complications. Other names: blood pressure reading, blood pressure test, blood pressure screening, sphygmomanometry1What is it used for? A blood pressure measurement is most often used to diagnose high blood pressure. Blood pressure that's too low, known as hypotension, is much less common. But you may get tested for low blood pressure if you have certain symptoms. Unlike high blood pressure, low blood pressure usually causes symptoms. These include: Dizziness or lightheadedness Nausea Cold, sweaty skin Pale skin Fainting Weakness1Why do I need a blood pressure test? A blood pressure measurement is often included as part of a regular checkup. Adults 18 years and older should have their blood pressure measured at least once every two to five years. You should get tested every year if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk if you: Are 40 years old or older Are overweight or have obesity Have a family history of heart disease or diabetes Take birth control pills Are Black/African American. Black/African Americans have a higher rate of high blood pressure than other racial and ethnic groups You may need this test if you have symptoms of low blood pressure.1What happens during a blood pressure test? A blood pressure test includes the following steps: You will sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. You will rest your arm on a table or other surface, so your arm is level with your heart. You may be asked to roll up your sleeve. Your provider will wrap a blood pressure cuff around your arm. A blood pressure cuff is a strap-like device. It should fit snugly around your upper arm, with the bottom edge placed just above your elbow. Your provider will inflate the blood pressure cuff using a small hand pump or by pressing a button on an automated device. Your provider will measure the pressure manually (by hand) or with an automated device.
    
If manually, he or she will place a stethoscope over the major artery in your upper arm to listen to the blood flow and pulse as the cuff inflates and deflates.
If using an automated device, the blood pressure cuff automatically inflates, deflates, and measures pressure.

 If manually, he or she will place a stethoscope over the major artery in your upper arm to listen to the blood flow and pulse as the cuff inflates and deflates. If using an automated device, the blood pressure cuff automatically inflates, deflates, and measures pressure. As the blood pressure cuff inflates, you'll feel it tighten around your arm. Your provider will then open a valve on the cuff to slowly release air from it. As the cuff deflates, blood pressure will fall. As the pressure falls, a measurement is taken when the sound of blood pulsing is first heard. This is the systolic pressure. As the air continues to be let out, the blood pulsing sound will start to go away. When it completely stops, another measurement is taken. This is the diastolic pressure. This test only takes about one minute to complete.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a blood pressure measurement.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have a little discomfort when the blood pressure cuff inflates and squeezes your arm. But this feeling only lasts for a few seconds.1What do the results mean? Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is: If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings. Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called "white coat syndrome." It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. 
For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.
 If you were tested for low blood pressure, a blood pressure reading of 90 systolic, 60 diastolic (90/60) or lower is considered abnormal. Treatments for low blood pressure may include medicines and making certain changes to your diet.1Is there anything else I need to know about a blood pressure measurement? If you were diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend one or more of the following lifestyle changes. Exercise regularly. Staying active can help lower your blood pressure and also help manage your weight. Most adults should aim for 150 minutes of physical activity per week. Check with your provider before beginning an exercise program. Keep a healthy weight. If you are overweight, losing as little as 5 pounds can lower your blood pressure. Eat a healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetable, and whole grains. Limit foods high in saturated fat and total fat. Reduce salt in your diet. Most adults should have less than 1500 mg of salt per day. Limit alcohol use. If you choose to drink, limit yourself to one drink a day if you are a woman; two drinks a day if you're a man. Don't smoke.1References American Heart Association [Internet]. Dallas (TX): American Heart Association Inc.; c2020. High Blood Pressure and African Americans; [cited 2020 Nov 30]; [about 4 screens].

A mental health screening is a standard set of questions that a person answers to help a health care provider check for signs of a mental disorder. The questions help the provider learn about a person's mood, thinking, behavior, and memory. A mental health screening is a way to catch mental health conditions early. If the screening shows signs of a disorder, more testing is usually needed to diagnose a specific mental disorder. Mental disorders are also called mental illnesses, and a mental health screening may be called a "mental illness test" or a "psychology test." More than half of all Americans will have a mental disorder at some point in their lives. Their symptoms may range from mild to severe. Common mental disorders include: Mood disorders, which include depression, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and self-harm. Anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Anxiety is a common disorder in children. Eating disorders, which include anorexia and bulimia. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is one of the most common mental health disorders in children. It can also continue into adulthood. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Personality disorders. Substance use disorders, which include alcohol use disorder and drug use and addiction. Psychotic disorders, which include schizophrenia. These and other mental disorders affect people of all ages, including children. So, there are special mental health screening tests designed for children, teenagers, and older adults. Some screening tests look for general signs of the most common mental disorders. Other screening tests look for signs related to specific types of disorders. Mental health screening can be an important part of your total health at every stage of life. Mental health symptoms can be a sign of certain physical conditions. And certain mental disorders can increase the risk of developing physical health problems. With proper mental health screening, diagnosis, and treatment, people with mental health disorders can get better and many recover completely. Other names: mental health assessment, mental illness test, psychological evaluation, psychology test, psychiatric evaluation1What is it used for? A mental health screening is usually used as the first step to find out if a person has signs of a mental disorder. It may be part of a routine checkup. A screening test is used to see whether a person: Has a risk for developing a mental disorder Needs more testing to diagnose or rule out a mental health disorder Needs mental health care right away, before diagnostic testing can be finished Mental health screening may also be used to see if treatment for a mental disorder is working. A primary care provider may use mental health screening to help decide if a person needs to see a mental health provider for testing and/or treatment. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. A mental health provider may use the results of a screening test to choose which other tests are needed to diagnose or rule out a specific mental disorder.1Why do I need a mental health screening? You or your child may need a mental health screening if you have symptoms of a mental disorder. Different disorders have specific symptoms. General symptoms of mental disorders may include: Eating or sleeping too much or too little Pulling away from people and usual activities Fatigue and lack of energy Feeling helpless, hopeless, or numb like nothing matters Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, nervous, angry, worried, or scared Severe mood swings that cause problems in relationships Thoughts and memories that you can't get out of your head Hearing voices or believing things that aren't true Thinking about death, suicide or harming yourself or others Signs of mental disorders in children may also include: Frequent tantrums and other behavior problems Frequent stomachaches or headaches without a known medical cause Difficulty in school Repeating actions or constantly checking things out of fear that something bad will happen Talking a lot about fears, worries, death, or suicide If you or someone you know needs immediate help for a mental health disorder: Call 911 or go to your local emergency room Contact a crisis hotline.

If you are having a mental health screening, you'll answer a set of questions about your symptoms. The questions will be about your feelings, mood, sleep, appetite, and other parts of your life. A provider may ask you the questions or you may fill out a questionnaire and discuss your answers afterwards. It's important that your answers are honest and complete. If your primary care provider is doing the screening, you may also have a physical exam and blood tests. There are no medical tests that can diagnose mental health disorders. But certain blood tests can show if a physical condition, such as thyroid disease or an electrolyte imbalance, is causing mental health symptoms. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. If your provider thinks your symptoms could be caused by physical problems with your brain or nerves, you may have a neurological exam or imaging tests of your brain. If your child is having a mental health screening, the test will be geared to your child's age and abilities. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your child's behavior. The screening may be done by your child's primary care provider or a mental health provider who works with children and teenagers. Your child's provider may also order medical tests to look for physical causes of mental disorders. Some schools provide mental health screening services.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a mental health screening? You usually don't need any special preparations for a mental health screening. If your child is having a screening, you may be asked to keep notes on your child's behavior for a few days before the test.1Are there any risks to screening? There is no risk to having a physical exam or taking a questionnaire. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Usually, the provider who did the screening will explain the results. If the results show signs of a mental health disorder, the next steps depend on the type of disorder and how serious it may be. If a primary care provider did the screening, the provider may: Talk with you about treatments Order tests to check for other health problems that may be causing symptoms Refer you or your child to a mental health provider A mental health provider may do more tests to confirm a diagnosis and help develop a treatment plan. Starting treatment as soon as possible may improve the chance of recovery. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a mental health screening? There are many types of mental health providers who treat mental disorders. Your or your child's primary health care provider or school can help you find the right support. These are some of the providers who have training to treat mental health disorders: Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in mental health. Psychiatrists can prescribe medicine. Psychologists generally have doctoral degrees, but they do not have medical degrees. They can't prescribe medicine unless they have a special license. Some psychologists work with providers who can prescribe medicine. Psychologists may use one-on-one counseling and/or group therapy sessions. Psychiatric-mental health nurses are nurses with special training in mental health problems. Nurses who may have a master's or doctoral degree in psychiatric-mental health nursing include, advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), certified nurse practitioners (CNPs), and clinical nurse specialists (CNSs). In some states, certain nurses can prescribe medicines. Licensed clinical social workers have at least a master's degree in social work with special training in mental health. They can't prescribe medicine, but may work with providers who can prescribe medicine. Providers who are licensed clinical social workers usually have LCSW or LICSW after their names. Licensed professional counselors (LPC) may also be called clinicians or therapists. States have different names of these licenses, such as LMFT (licensed marriage and family therapist). These professionals usually have a master's degree in a field related to mental health. They can't prescribe medicine but may work with providers who can prescribe.1References American Academy of Pediatrics [Internet]. Elk Grove Village (IL): American Academy of Pediatrics; c2022.

This test measures the amount of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in your blood or urine. MMA is a substance made in small amounts during metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how your body changes food into energy. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in metabolism. If your body doesn't have enough vitamin B12, it will make extra amounts of MMA. High MMA levels can be a sign of a vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to serious health problems including anemia, a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal amount of red blood cells. Other names: MMA1What is it used for? An MMA test is most often used to diagnose a vitamin B12 deficiency. This test is also used to diagnose methylmalonic acidemia, a rare genetic disorder. Symptoms of this disorder can range from mild to severe and may include vomiting, dehydration, developmental delays, and intellectual disability. The test is usually included as part of a series of tests called a newborn screening. A newborn screening helps diagnose a variety of serious health conditions.1Why do I need an MMA test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a vitamin B12 deficiency. These include: Fatigue Loss of appetite Tingling in hands and/or feet Mood changes Confusion Irritability Pale skin If you have a new baby, he or she will probably be tested as part of a newborn screening.1What happens during an MMA test? MMA levels may be checked in blood or urine.  During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. During a newborn screening, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site. MMA urine testing may be ordered as a 24-hour urine sample test or a random urine test. For a 24-hour urine sample test, you'll need to collect all urine passed in a 24-hour period. Your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test generally includes the following steps: Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time. For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided. Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice. Return the sample container to your health care provider's office or the laboratory as instructed. For a random urine test, your sample of urine may be collected any time of the day.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to you or your baby during an MMA blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly. There is no known risk to having a urine test.1What do the results mean? If your results show higher than normal levels of MMA, it may mean you have a vitamin B12 deficiency. The test can't show how much of a deficiency you have or whether your condition is likely to get better or worse. To help make a diagnosis, your results may be compared with other tests including a homocysteine blood test and/or vitamin B tests. Lower than normal levels of MMA are not common and not considered a health problem. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. If your baby has moderate or high levels of MMA, it may mean he or she has methylmalonic acidemia. Left untreated, it can cause life-threatening complications. If your baby is diagnosed with this disorder, talk to your child's health care provider about treatment options. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Lab Tests Online [Internet].

Microalbumin creatinine ratio urine test is a way of checking for very small amounts of a protein called albumin in a sample of your urine (pee). Small amounts of albumin in urine, sometimes called microalbumin, may be one of the first signs of kidney disease. If you find kidney disease early, you can get treatment before it gets worse. Albumin is the main protein found in blood. When healthy kidneys clean waste from your blood, tiny filters prevent large albumin molecules from leaving your body in urine. Normally, just a trace of albumin, or none at all, will get through the filters. But if your kidneys are damaged, larger amounts of albumin may pass into your urine. Creatinine is a normal waste product in urine that comes from daily wear and tear on your muscles. A microalbumin creatinine ratio test compares the amount of albumin to the amount of creatinine in your urine. This is a more accurate way to measure the amount of albumin in your urine. In most cases, your health care provider can use the test results from a single urine sample to estimate how much albumin passes into your urine during a 24-hour period. Other names: albumin-creatinine ratio; urine albumin; microalbumin, urine; ACR; UACR1What is it used for? A microalbumin creatinine ratio test is most often used to look for signs of kidney disease in people who have a high risk of developing it, but don't have symptoms. You're more likely to develop kidney disease if you: Have diabetes Have high blood pressure Have a family health history of kidney disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure Have heart disease Are over 50 years old Smoke Have obesity If you have had an abnormal albumin in urine test or have been diagnosed with kidney disease, a microalbumin creatinine ratio test may also be used to monitor your condition or to see how well your treatment is working.1Why do I need a microalbumin creatinine ratio test? Early kidney disease usually doesn't have any symptoms. So, if you have a high risk for kidney disease, you need a microalbumin creatinine ratio test so you can find kidney disease and treat it before it causes serious health problems. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of kidney disease. If you have diabetes, you should get tested for kidney disease every year. You may need to be tested more often if your last test results showed albumin levels higher than the goal your provider set for you. If you have other conditions that increase your risk for getting kidney disease, such as high blood pressure or heart disease, ask your provider how often you need get tested.1What happens during a microalbumin creatinine ratio test? There are several ways to collect a urine sample for a microalbumin creatinine ratio test: A "random" or "spot" urine sample means that you collect a single urine sample at any time of the day. You will usually collect this sample at your provider's office or at a medical lab. An early morning or timed urine sample is collected first thing in the morning or after not going to the bathroom for four hours. You'll likely be given a kit and instructions to collect your urine at home. A 24-hour urine sample requires you to collect all your urine over a 24-hour period. This test is usually used to follow up on abnormal results from a test on a single sample of urine. A 24-hour urine test is the most accurate way to measure albumin in urine. For a random urine sample, a health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. For home collection for an early morning or timed urine sample, the instructions will be about the same as for a random urine sample. Be sure to follow the instructions that come with your collection kit. For a 24-hour urine sample, you will be given a special container to collect your urine over a full day and instructions on how to collect and store your sample. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container./li>
 During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Before providing your urine sample, you may need to avoid: Intense exercise. Hard exercise may increase the amount of albumin in your urine for a short time. Eating meat. Meat can affect your creatinine levels, so you may be asked not to eat any for a day before your test. Check with your provider about how to prepare for your test. Be sure ask if any medicines or supplements you take could affect your results.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to providing a urine sample for a microalbumin creatinine ratio test.1What do the results mean? If your microalbumin creatinine ratio shows an abnormal amount of albumin in your urine, you will likely need more tests to confirm your results. That's because temporary increases in albumin levels may be caused by exercise, certain medicines, fever, and inflammation in the body. Usually, you will have two more tests in the three to six months after your first test. If two out of three tests show abnormal levels of albumin in your urine, you may have early-stage kidney disease. Higher or increasing amounts of albumin in your urine usually mean you have: More serious kidney disease that's likely to get worse faster A higher risk for developing problems with your heart and blood vessels (vascular diseases) Smaller amounts of albumin in your urine don't always mean you have kidney disease. Other conditions that cause inflammation may increase albumin in urine, including: Urinary tract infections Gum infections (periodontitis) Hepatitis Your test results may also be affected by how much muscle you have, and your diet, age, and race. If you have an abnormal result, your provider will usually order other kidney tests, including a blood test called an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) test. Talk with your provider about what your test results mean. If you're diagnosed with early kidney disease, there are steps you can take to reduce the amount of albumin in your urine and protect your health. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a microalbumin creatinine ratio? It's easy to confuse prealbumin with albumin. Although they sound similar, prealbumin is a different type of protein. A prealbumin test is not part of testing your kidney health.1References American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995–2022.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/tu6440 Mononucleosis (Mono) Tests : 1What are mononucleosis (mono) tests? Mononucleosis (mono) is an infectious disease caused by a virus. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of mono, but other viruses can also cause the disease. EBV is a type of herpes virus and is very common. Most Americans have been infected with EBV by the age of 40 but may never get symptoms of mono. Young children infected with EBV usually have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Teens and young adults, though, are more likely to get mono and experience noticeable symptoms. In fact, at least one out of four teens and adults who get EBV will develop mono. Mono can cause symptoms similar to those of the flu. Mono is rarely serious, but symptoms can linger for weeks or months. Mono is sometimes called the kissing disease because it is spread through saliva. You can also get mono if you share a drinking glass, food, or utensils with an a person who has mono. Types of mono tests include: Monospot test. This test looks for specific antibodies in the blood. These antibodies show up during or after during certain infections, including mono. EBV antibody test. This test looks for EBV antibodies, the main cause of mono. There are different types of EBV antibodies. If certain types of antibodies are found, it may mean you were infected recently. Other types of EBV antibodies may mean you were infected in the past. Other names: monospot test, mononuclear heterophile test, heterophile antibody test, EBV antibody test, Epstein-Barr virus antibodies1What are they used for? Mono tests are used to help diagnose a mono infection. Your provider may use a monospot to get fast results. Results are usually ready within an hour. But this test has a high rate of false negatives. So monospot tests are often ordered with an EVB antibody test and other tests that look for infections. These include: Complete blood count and/or blood smear, which checks for high levels of white blood cells, a sign of infection. Throat culture, to check for strep throat, which has similar symptoms to mono. Strep throat is a bacterial infection treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics don't work on viral infections like mono.1Why do I need a mono test?  Your health care provider may order one or more mono tests if you or your child has symptoms of mono. Symptoms include: Fever Sore throat Swollen glands, especially in the neck and/or armpits Fatigue Headache Rash1What happens during a mono test? You will need to provide a sample of blood from your fingertip or from a vein. For a fingertip blood test, a health care professional will prick your middle or ring finger with a small needle. After wiping away the first drop of blood, he or she will place a little tube on your finger and collect a small amount of blood. You may feel a pinch when the needle pricks your finger. For a blood test from a vein, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. Both types of tests are quick, usually taking less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for a fingertip blood test or blood test from a vein.1Are there any risks to mono tests There is very little risk to having a fingertip blood test or blood test from a vein. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If monospot test results were positive, it may mean you or your child has mono. If it was negative, but you or your child still has symptoms, your health care provider will probably order an EBV antibody test. If your EBV test was negative, it means you don't currently have an EBV infection and were never infected with the virus. A negative result means your symptoms are probably caused by another disorder. If your EBV test was positive, it means EBV antibodies were found in your blood. The test will also show which types of antibodies were found. This allows your provider to find out whether you were infected recently or in the past. While there is no cure for mono, you can take steps to relieve symptoms. These include: Get plenty of rest Drink lots of fluids Suck on lozenges or hard candy to soothe a sore throat Take over-the-counter relievers. But don't give aspirin to children or teens because it may cause Reye syndrome, a serious, sometimes fatal, disease that affects the brain and liver. Mono usually goes away on its own within a few weeks. Fatigue may last a bit longer. Health care providers recommend children avoid sports for at least a month after symptoms have gone. This helps avoid injury to the spleen, which may be at a higher risk for damage during and just after an active mono infection. If you have questions about your results or treatment for mono, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about mono tests? Some people think that EBV causes a disorder called chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). But as of now, researchers have not found any evidence to show this is true. So monospot and EBV tests are not used to diagnose or monitor CFS.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Platelets are small blood cells that stick together to make blood clots that stop or slow bleeding when you have a cut or injury.  Platelets are made in your bone marrow. An MPV blood test measures the average size of your platelets. The test can help diagnose bleeding disorders and diseases of the bone marrow. Other names: Mean Platelet Volume1What is it used for? An MPV blood test is used to help diagnose or monitor many blood-related conditions. The test may also be used to help diagnose other health conditions or find out how serious they may be. A test called a platelet count is often done with an MVP test. A platelet count measures the total number of platelets in your blood.1Why do I need an MPV blood test? Your health care provider may order an MPV blood test as part of a complete blood count (CBC), which measures many different parts of your blood, including platelets. A CBC test is often part of a routine exam. You may also need an MPV test if you have symptoms of a blood disorder that may involve having too many or too few platelets. These symptoms include: Bleeding that takes a long time to stop, even from minor cuts Nosebleeds Bleeding from brushing your teeth Small red or purplish spots on the skin Bruising easily Abnormal vaginal bleeding (especially heavy menstrual periods) Feeling weak or dizzy Lasting headache and dizziness Pain and burning in the feet and hands1What happens during an MPV blood test? During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an MPV blood test. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? An MPV test alone can't diagnose a health condition. Your provider will use your MPV results along with your platelet counts and other test results to get a more complete picture of your health. Depending on your platelet count and other blood test results, an MPV result that's higher than normal may be a sign of: Thrombocytopenia, not having enough platelets Myeloproliferative diseases, blood cancers in which the bone marrow makes too many platelets or other blood cells Preeclampsia, a complication in pregnancy that causes high blood pressure. It usually starts after the 20th week of pregnancy. Heart disease Diabetes Hemolytic anemia A low MPV test result may be a sign of: Certain cancers Side effects from certain medicines Aplastic anemia Autoimmune diseases Bacterial or viral infections Genetic conditions Alcohol use disorder (AUD) To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an MPV blood test? Many things can affect the results of your MPV blood test. Your age, sex, race and ethnicity, lifestyle (diet, smoking, drinking alcohol, physical activity), and genes can affect both your MPV and platelet counts.1References Bessman JD, Gilmer PR, Gardner FH.

MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is a type of staph bacteria. Many people have staph bacteria living on their skin or in their noses. These bacteria usually don't cause any harm. But when staph enters the body through a cut, scrape, or other open wound, it can cause a skin infection. Most staph skin infections are minor and heal on their own or after treatment with antibiotics. MRSA bacteria are different than other staph bacteria. In a normal staph infection, antibiotics will kill the disease-causing bacteria and prevent them from growing. In a MRSA infection, the antibiotics usually used to treat staph infections don't work. The bacteria are not killed and continue to grow. When common antibiotics don't work on bacterial infections, it's known as antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance makes it very difficult to treat certain bacterial infections. Every year, nearly 3 million people in the United States are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and more than 35,000 people die from the infections. In the past, MRSA infections mostly happened to hospital patients. Now, MRSA is becoming more common in healthy people. The infection can be spread from person to person or through contact with objects that are contaminated with the bacteria. It is not spread through the air like a cold or flu virus. But you can get a MRSA infection if you share personal items such as a towel or a razor. You may also get the infection if you have close, personal contact with someone who has an infected wound. This can happen when large groups of people are close together, such as in a college dorm, locker room, or military barracks. A MRSA test looks for the MRSA bacteria in a sample from a wound, nostril, or other body fluid. MRSA can be treated with special, powerful antibiotics. If left untreated, a MRSA infection can lead to serious illness or death. Other names: MRSA screening, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screening1What are they used for? This test is most often used to find out if you have a MRSA infection. The test may also be used to see if treatment for a MRSA infection is working.1Why do I need a MRSA test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a MRSA infection. Symptoms depend on where the infection is located. Most MRSA infections are in the skin, but the bacteria can spread to the bloodstream, lungs, and other organs. A MRSA infection on the skin may look like a type of rash. A MRSA rash looks like red, swollen bumps on the skin. Some people may mistake a MRSA rash for a spider bite. The infected area may also be: Warm to the touch Painful Symptoms of a MRSA infection in the bloodstream or other parts of the body include: Fever Chills Headache MRSA rash1What happens during a MRSA test? A health care provider will take a fluid sample from your wound, nose, blood, or urine. Steps may include the following: Wound sample: A provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound. Nasal swab: A provider will put a special swab inside each nostril and twirl it around to collect the sample. Blood test: A provider will take a sample of blood from a vein in your arm. Urine test: You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider. After your test, your sample will be sent to a lab for testing. Most tests take 24-48 hours to get results. That's because it takes time to grow enough bacteria to be detected. But a new test, called the cobas vivoDx MRSA test, can deliver results much faster. The test, which is done on nasal swabs, can find MRSA bacteria in as little as five hours. Talk to your health care provider to see if this new test would be a good choice for you.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a MRSA test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a wound sample, swab, or urine test. You may feel a little pain when a sample is taken from a wound. A nasal swab may be slightly uncomfortable. These effects are usually mild and temporary. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results are positive, it means you have a MRSA infection. Treatment will depend on how serious the infection is. For mild skin infections, your provider may clean, drain, and cover the wound. You may also get an antibiotic to put on the wound or take by mouth. Certain antibiotics still work for some MRSA infections. For more serious cases, you may need to go to the hospital and get treated with powerful antibiotics through an IV (intravenous line). Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about MRSA tests? The following steps can reduce your risk of getting a MRSA infection: Wash your hands often and thoroughly, using soap and water. Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered until they are fully healed. Don't share personal items such as towels and razors. You can also take steps to reduce antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when people don't use antibiotics in the right way. To prevent antibiotic resistance: Take antibiotics as prescribed, making sure to finish the medicine even after you feel better. Don't use antibiotics if you don't have a bacterial infection. Antibiotics don't work on viral infections. Don't use antibiotics prescribed for someone else. Don't use old or leftover antibiotics.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

A MTHFR gene test uses a sample of your blood to look for two very common changes in a gene called MTHFR. A change in this gene is also called an MTHFR variant or MTHFR mutation. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. You have two copies of the MTHFR gene, one from each parent. The genes provide instructions for making the MTHFR protein. This protein helps your body use folate, a type of B vitamin that you get from many foods. Your body needs folate and other B vitamins to break down an amino acid called homocysteine. Normally, your body quickly breaks down homocysteine, so you have very little in your bloodstream. But if you have a change in an MTHFR gene, the MTHFR proteins your body makes may not process folate as well as they should. As a result, you may have increased levels of homocysteine in your blood. In general, researchers aren't certain that increased homocysteine levels directly cause health problems. But some studies have linked too much homocysteine to damage to the inside of your blood vessels. This may increase the risk for blood clots, heart disease, and stroke. Also, the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects is slightly higher if homocysteine levels are high during pregnancy. Even if a homocysteine blood test shows that your homocysteine levels are higher than normal, an MTHFR gene test is generally not needed. That's because the treatment for high homocysteine levels is the same whether or not it's caused by a common change in your MTHFR gene.  To lower homocysteine levels, your health care provider will usually recommend taking vitamin B supplements that include folic acid, which is a form of folate. The extra vitamins can make up for an MTHFR gene that's not fully working. Your provider may recommend eating more foods with folate, too. Before making changes in your health habits, talk with your provider. Studies show that taking folic acid greatly reduces the risk of neural tube defects in babies. So, folic acid supplements are recommended for everyone who may become pregnant. Folic acid  may also decrease the risk of stroke from a blood clot in adults. But this treatment doesn't appear to decrease the risk of heart disease. Other names:  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase  mutation, C677T and A1298C, MTHFR DNA assay, MTHFR DNA testing, MTHFR gene variants, MTHFR gene polymorphisms 677T>C & 1298A>C mutations1What is it used for? An MTHFR gene test is used to look for the two most common MTHFR changes called C677T and A1298C. It's possible to have one or both of these gene changes without having any health problems. An MTHFR gene test may be done alone or as part of a group of genetic tests. The test may be used to: Find out if a common MTHFR gene change is causing increased homocysteine in your blood.  But the treatment for high homocysteine is the same whether or not you have a gene change. Estimate the risk of developing blood clots or early heart or blood vessel disease. Researchers aren't certain whether homocysteine levels affect the risk of these diseases, so some medical experts recommend against using MTHFR testing for this purpose. Different types of gene tests are used to look for rare types of MTHFR gene changes that can lead to very high levels of homocysteine in both blood and urine. This causes a serious disease called homocystinuria. Symptoms usually show up in the first year of life. In mild cases, symptoms may not appear until childhood or later. In the U.S., most newborns have a routine screening test to check for signs of homocystinuria.1Why do I need an MTHFR gene test? In general, medical experts do not recommend testing for common MTHFR gene changes. But the test may be ordered if: You had a blood test that showed higher than normal levels of homocysteine A close relative was diagnosed with an MTHFR gene change You and/or close family members have early heart or blood vessel disease You may need an MTHFR gene test if your provider prescribes a medicine called methotrexate. Methotrexate is used to treat certain types of cancer, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The MTHFR protein helps your body use this medicine properly. The results of a MTHFR gene test may help your provider choose the dose that will be safe for you.1What happens during an MTHFR gene test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an MTHFR gene test.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The results of an MTHFR gene test tell you whether you have one or both of the two most common changes in the MTHFR gene. Test results are usually reported as positive or negative: A positive test result means that you have an MTHFR gene change in one or both of your MTHFR genes. Having a change in only one of your MTHFR genes is unlikely to cause any health problems. If your homocysteine levels are high and your MTHFR gene test shows that you have:


Two copies of the C677T gene change or one copy each of C677T and A1298C, then these gene changes are probably causing your increased homocysteine levels
Two copies of the A1298C gene change, then your increased homocysteine levels are probably not caused by these gene changes

 Two copies of the C677T gene change or one copy each of C677T and A1298C, then these gene changes are probably causing your increased homocysteine levels Two copies of the A1298C gene change, then your increased homocysteine levels are probably not caused by these gene changes A negative test result means that neither of the common MTHFR gene changes were found in your blood sample. If you have an increased homocysteine level, it's probably from another condition, such as a lack of B vitamins, taking certain medicines, older age, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, or another disease. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an MTHFR gene test? You might have read or heard that folic acid is not safe if you have one or two copies of the MTHFR C677T gene change. This is not true. Even if you have one or two copies of this gene change, your body can safely and effectively process folic acid supplements and all types of folates in food.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Mucus is a thick, slippery fluid that coats and moistens certain parts of the body, including the nose, mouth, throat, and urinary tract. A small amount of mucus in your urine (pee) is normal. Having too much mucus may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other medical condition. A test called urinalysis can detect whether there is too much mucus in your urine. Other names: microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine, urine test, urine analysis, UA1What is it used for? A mucus in urine test may be part of a urinalysis. A urinalysis may be done during a regular check-up, or your health care provider may order the test if you have signs of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other condition that can cause mucus in urine. A urinalysis may include a visual check of your urine sample, tests for certain chemicals, and an examination under a microscope to look for certain types of cells. A mucus in urine test is part of a microscopic exam of urine.1Why do I need a mucus in urine test? A urinalysis is often part of a routine checkup. Your provider may include a mucus in urine test in your urinalysis if you have symptoms of a UTI. These include: Frequent urge to urinate, even when you have little urine in your bladder Painful urination Dark, cloudy, or reddish-colored urine Bad smelling urine Weakness Fatigue1What happens during a mucus in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container being careful not to touch the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) should be separated and wiped from front to back on the inner sides.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) should be separated and wiped from front to back on the inner sides. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds, then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for this test. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a test for mucus in urine.1What do the results mean? A normal test result usually shows a small or moderate amount of mucus in your urine.  A large amount of mucus may be a sign of a medical problem, including: A urinary tract infection (UTI) A sexually transmitted disease (STD) Kidney stones Irritable bowel syndrome Bladder cancer To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a mucus in urine test? If a urinalysis is part of your regular checkup, your urine will be tested for a variety of substances along with mucus. These include red and white blood cells, proteins, acid and sugar levels, and the concentration of particles in your urine. If you get frequent UTIs, your provider may recommend more testing, as well as steps that may help prevent future infections.1References ClinLabNavigator. [Internet]. ClinLabNavigator; c2022.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) tests are used to diagnose MG, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes weakness in muscles throughout the body. An autoimmune disorder causes your immune system to attack your own cells, tissues, and/or organs by mistake. If you have MG, your immune system makes antibodies that block or change the connection between nerves and muscles. MG affects voluntary muscles in your body. These are muscles that you choose to move. Muscles that control the eyelids are often the first and sometimes the only muscles affected by MG. Other muscles involved can include those in the jaw, neck, and limbs. Muscles that control breathing may also be affected. MG is not inherited or contagious. It most commonly affects women under age 40 and men over age 60, but it can occur at any age. MG testing can help you get diagnosed and treated for the disease. While there is no cure for MG, there are treatments that can relieve symptoms and may even allow you to have periods of time without any symptoms (remission). Other names: Ice pack test, edrophonium test, tensilon test, nerve conduction study1What are they used for? MG tests are used to diagnose MG.1Why do I need MG testing? You may need to be tested if you have symptoms of MG. These include: Drooping of one or both eyelids Double vision Weakness in arms, hands, fingers, legs, and/or neck Trouble chewing and/or swallowing Trouble talking Fatigue Shortness of breath MG symptoms usually get worse after periods of activity, such as exercise, and improve after periods of rest.1What happens during MG testing? MG can be hard to diagnose because muscle weakness can be symptom of many disorders. So, your provider may order more than one type of MG test to help make a diagnosis. Types of MG tests include: Neurological exam. During this test, a provider will take your medical history and conduct a physical exam, which will include checking your: Reflexes Muscle strength Muscle tone Coordination Balance Sense of touch and sight Ice pack test. This test may be done if you have a droopy eyelid. During the test: Your provider will place an ice pack or bag filled with ice on your eyelid. The ice will be removed after two minutes. If drooping improves, it may mean you have MG. This is because cooling temporarily improves muscle weakness that's caused by MG. Antibody test. This is a blood test that looks for certain types of antibodies that are found in people with MG. During the test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. Electromyography (EMG). This test measures the electrical signals your muscles make when they are at rest and when they are being used. During the test: Your provider will place a needle electrode into your muscle. A needle electrode is a special wire that a mild electric current flows through. A machine will record the muscle activity while your muscle is at rest. Then you will be asked to tighten (contract) the muscle slowly and steadily. The machine will record the muscle activity while your muscle is contracted. The electrode may be moved to record activity in different muscles. The electrical activity is shown on a video screen. Nerve conduction study. This test measures how fast and how well the body's electrical signals travel down your nerves. During the test: Your provider will attach one or more electrodes to a certain nerve or nerves using tape or a paste. The electrodes, called stimulating electrodes, deliver a mild electrical pulse. These electrodes will record the responses to the electrical stimulation from the nerve. Your provider will send a small pulse of electricity through the stimulating electrodes to trigger the nerve to send a signal to the muscle. Your provider will record the time it takes for your muscle to respond to the nerve signal. Imaging tests. Many people with MG have problems with the thymus gland, a small organ in your upper chest. Your provider may order a CT scan (computed tomography) or an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to see if you have an enlarged thymus or a thymus tumor, which can be a sign of MG. During a CT scan: You will lie on a narrow table that slides into a scanning machine. Once you are in the scanner, the machine will take a series of pictures as it rotates around you. During an MRI: You will lie on a narrow table that will slide into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The scanner will take pictures using powerful magnets and radio waves. It does not use radiation. For both imaging tests, you will need to hold as still as possible. You may also be asked to hold your breath at times while images are being taken. Edrophonium test. Edrophonium is a drug that briefly relieves muscle weakness in people with MG. It's mostly used to test weakness in the eye muscles. During the test: A provider will inject the drug through an IV (intravenous) line. If muscle weakness briefly improves, it may mean you have MG. Lung function tests. These tests measure breathing and how well your lungs are working. There are several types of lung function tests. For most tests, you will breathe into some type of mouthpiece or machine as your breath is measured. For some tests, you may need to inhale a type of gas or medicine.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests? You don't need any special preparations for a neurological exam, ice pack test, or antibody test. For the other tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) or avoid certain foods and beverages before the test. Your provider will let you know if you need to make any special preparations.1Are there any risks to these tests? There is no risk to having a neurological exam or an ice pack test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. You may feel a little pain or cramping during an EMG test. During a nerve conduction study, you may have a tingly feeling, like a mild electric shock. CT scans and MRIs are painless, but can be a little uncomfortable. Some people feel claustrophobic in an MRI scanning machine. An edrophonium test may cause an allergic reaction. It is not common, but contact your provider if you have breathing problems, vision changes, and/or feel faint after taking the medicine. There is very little risk to having lung function tests. Some people may feel lightheaded or dizzy during the procedures.1What do the results mean? If one or more of the tests indicate MG, your provider will probably start you on a treatment plan. With treatment, most people with MG can significantly improve their muscle weakness and have a normal or nearly normal quality of life. Treatment options include: Medicines. There are different kinds of medicines used to help improve muscle strength. Plasmapheresis. In this procedure, a special machine is used to remove harmful antibodies from plasma, the liquid part of the blood. It then replaces the harmful plasma with normal plasma or a plasma substitute. IV Immunoglobulin (IVIG). In this procedure, you receive infusions of antibodies from a healthy donor. IVIG is usually done over a period of two to five days.


The effects of plasmapheresis and IVIG only last for a few weeks to months. So the procedures may need to be repeated frequently, depending on the severity of your symptoms.

 The effects of plasmapheresis and IVIG only last for a few weeks to months. So the procedures may need to be repeated frequently, depending on the severity of your symptoms. Surgery. Your provider may recommend surgical removal of the thymus gland, which is often abnormal in people with MG. The procedure can reduce symptoms, even in people without thymus tumors. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about MG testing? If you've been diagnosed with MG, the following lifestyle changes may also help boost muscle strength: Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of protein and carbohydrates. Exercise regularly to strengthen muscles, under the guidance of your health care provider. Avoid heat and stress, which can make symptoms worse. Wear an eye patch if you have double vision. Take naps or rest breaks throughout the day.1References Cleveland Clinic [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c2021. Edrophonium Injection; [cited 2021 Jul 21]; [about 3 screens].

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/myasthenia-gravis-2860863 Myelography : 1What is myelography? Myelography, also called a myelogram, is an imaging test that checks for problems in your spinal canal. The spinal canal contains your spinal cord, nerve roots, and the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space is a fluid-filled space between the spinal cord and the membrane that covers it. During the test, contrast dye is injected into the spinal canal. Contrast dye is a substance that makes specific organs, blood vessels, and tissue show up more clearly on an x-ray. Myelography involves using one of these two imaging procedures: Fluoroscopy, a type of x-ray that shows internal tissues, structures, and organs moving in real time. CT scan (computerized tomography), a procedure that combines a series of x-ray images taken from different angles around the body. Other names: myelogram 1What is it used for? Myelography is used to look for conditions and diseases that affect the nerves, blood vessels, and structures in the spinal canal. These include: Herniated disk. Spinal disks are rubbery cushions (disks) that sit between the bones of your spine. A herniated disk is a condition in which the disk bulges out and presses on spinal nerves or the spinal cord. Tumors Spinal stenosis, a condition that causes swelling and damage to the bones and tissues around the spinal cord. This leads to narrowing of the spinal canal. Infections, such as meningitis, that affect the membranes and tissues of the spinal cord Arachnoiditis, a condition that causes inflammation of a membrane that covers the spinal cord1Why do I need myelography? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a spinal disorder, such as: Pain in the back, neck, and/or leg Tingling sensations Weakness Trouble walking Trouble with tasks that involve small muscle groups, such as buttoning a shirt1What happens during myelography? A myelography may be done at a radiology center or in the radiology department of a hospital. The procedure usually includes the following steps: You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown. You will lie on your stomach on a padded x-ray table. Your provider will clean your back with an antiseptic solution. You will be injected with numbing medicine, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Once the area is numb, your provider will use a thin needle to inject contrast dye into your spinal canal. You may feel some pressure when the needle goes in, but it should not hurt. Your provider may remove a sample of spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) for testing. Your x-ray table will be tilted in different directions to allow the contrast dye to move to different areas of the spinal cord. Your provider will remove the needle. Your provider will capture and record images using fluoroscopy or a CT scan. After the test, you may be monitored for one to two hours. You may also be advised to lie down at home for a few hours and to avoid strenuous activity for one to two days after the test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your provider may ask you to drink extra fluids on the day before the test. On the day of the test, you will probably be asked to not eat or drink anything, except for clear fluids. These include water, clear broth, tea, and black coffee. Talk to your provider about any medicines you are taking. Certain medicines, especially aspirin and blood thinners, should not be taken before your test. Your provider will let you know how long you need to avoid these medicines. It may be as long as 72 hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test?  You should not take this test if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to an unborn baby. For others, there is little risk to having this test. The dose of radiation is very low and is not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time. There is a small risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast dye. Tell your provider if you have any allergies, especially to shellfish or iodine, or if you've ever had a reaction to contrast material. Other risks include headache and nausea and vomiting. The headache may last for up to 24 hours. Serious reactions are rare but may include seizures, infection, and a blockage in the spinal canal.1What do the results mean? If your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Herniated disk Spinal stenosis Tumor Nerve injury Bone spurs Arachnoiditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the spinal cord) A normal result means your spinal canal and structures were normal in size, position, and shape. Your provider may want to do more tests to find out what is causing your symptoms. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about myelography? MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has replaced the need for myelography in many cases. MRIs  use a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of organs and structures inside the body. But myelography can be more useful in diagnosing some conditions, such as certain spinal tumors and spinal disk problems. It's also used for people who are unable to have an MRI because they have metal or electronic devices in their bodies. These include a pacemaker, surgical screws, and cochlear implants.1References Cleveland Clinic [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c2020.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw233057  Nasal Swab : 1What is a nasal swab? A nasal swab, is a test that checks for viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory infections.   There are many types of respiratory infections. A nasal swab test can help your provider diagnose the type of infection you have and which treatment would be best for you. The test may be done by taking a sample of cells from your nostrils or from the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx is the uppermost part of your nose and throat.   Other names: anterior nares test, nasal mid-turbinate swab, NMT swab nasopharyngeal culture, nasopharyngeal swab 1What is it used for? A nasal swab is used to diagnose certain infections of the respiratory system. These include: The flu COVID-19 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This is a common and usually mild respiratory infection. But it can be dangerous to young babies and older adults. Whooping cough, a bacterial infection that causes severe fits of coughing and trouble breathing Meningitis, a disease caused by inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), a serious type of bacterial infection that can be very difficult to treat1Why do I need a nasal swab? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a respiratory infection. These include: Cough Fever Stuffy or runny nose Sore throat Headache Fatigue Muscle aches1What happens during a nasal swab? A nasal swab may be taken from the: Front part of your nostrils (anterior nares) Back of your nostrils, in a procedure known as nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab.  Nasopharynx (uppermost part of your nose and throat) In some cases, a health care provider will ask you to do an anterior nares test or an NMT swab yourself.  During an anterior nares test, you will start by tilting your head back. Then you or the provider will: Gently insert a swab inside your nostril. Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10-15 seconds. ·Remove the swab and insert into your second nostril. Swab the second nostril using the same technique. Remove the swab. If you are doing the test yourself, the provider will let you know how to seal your sample. During an NMT swab, you will start by tilting your head back. Then you or your provider will: Gently insert a swab onto the bottom of the nostril, pushing it until you feel it stopping. Rotate the swab for 15 seconds. Remove the swab and insert into your second nostril. Swab the second nostril using the same technique. Remove the swab. If you are doing the test yourself, the provider will let you know how to seal your sample. During a nasopharyngeal swab:  You will tip your head back. Your health care provider will insert a swab into your nostril until it reaches your nasopharynx (the upper part of your throat). Your provider will rotate the swab and remove it.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a nasal swab.1Are there any risks to the test? The test may tickle your throat or cause you to cough. A nasopharyngeal swab may be uncomfortable and cause coughing or gagging. All these effects are temporary.1What do the results mean? Depending on your symptoms, you may have been tested for one or more types of infections. A negative result means no harmful viruses or bacteria were found in your sample. A positive result means a specific type of harmful virus or bacteria was found in your sample. It indicates you have a specific type of infection. If you are diagnosed with an infection, be sure to follow your provider's recommendations for treating your illness. This may include medicines and steps to prevent spreading the infection to others. If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, be sure to stay in touch with your provider to find out the best way to take care of yourself and protect others from infection. To learn more, check the websites of the CDC and your local health department. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Allina Health [Internet].

Natriuretic peptides are substances made by the heart. Two main types of these substances are brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Normally, only small levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are found in the bloodstream. High levels can mean your heart isn't pumping as much blood as your body needs. When this happens, it's known as heart failure, sometimes called congestive heart failure. Natriuretic peptide tests measure the levels of BNP or NT-proBNP in your blood. Your health care provider may order a BNP test or an NT-proBNP test, but not both. They are both useful in diagnosing heart failure, but rely on different types of measurements. The choice will depend on the equipment available in your provider's recommended laboratory. Other names: brain natriuretic peptide, NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide test, B-type natriuretic peptide1What are they used for? A BNP test or an NT-proBNP test is most often used to diagnose or rule out heart failure. If you've already been diagnosed with heart failure, the test may be used to: Find out the severity of the condition Plan treatment Find out if treatment is working The test may also be used to find out whether or not your symptoms are due to heart failure.1Why do I need a natriuretic peptide test? You may need a BNP test or an NT-proBNP test if you have symptoms of heart failure. These include: Difficulty breathing Coughing or wheezing Fatigue Swelling in abdomen, legs, and/or feet Loss of appetite or nausea If you are being treated for heart failure, your health care provider may order one of these tests to see how well your treatment is working.1What happens during a natriuretic peptide test? For a BNP test or an NT-proBNP test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a BNP test or an NT-proBNP test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your BNP or NT-proBNP levels were higher than normal, it probably means you have heart failure. Usually, the higher the level, the more serious your condition is. If your BNP or NT-proBNP results were normal, it probably means your symptoms are not being caused by heart failure. Your provider may order more tests to help make a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a natriuretic peptide test? Your health care provider may order one or more of the following tests in addition to or after you've had a BNP or NT-proBNP test: Electrocardiogram, which looks at heart's electrical activity Stress test, which shows how well your heart handles physical activity Chest x-ray to see if your heart is larger than normal or if you have fluid in your lungs You may also get one or more of the following blood tests: ANP test. ANP stands for atrial natriuretic peptide. ANP is similar to BNP but it is made in a different part of the heart. Metabolic panel to check for kidney disease, which has similar symptoms to heart failure Complete blood count to check for anemia or other blood disorders1References American Heart Association [Internet].

A neurological exam checks for disorders of the central nervous system. The central nervous system is made of your brain, spinal cord, and nerves from these areas. It controls and coordinates everything you do, including muscle movement, organ function, and even complex thinking and planning. There are more than 600 types of central nervous system disorders. The most common disorders include: Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Meningitis Epilepsy Stroke Migraine headaches A neurological exam is made up of a series of tests. The tests examine your balance, muscle strength, and other functions of the central nervous system. Other names: neuro exam1What is it used for? A neurological exam is used to help find out if you have a disorder of the nervous system. Early diagnosis can help you get the right treatment and may decrease long-term complications.1Why do I need a neurological exam? You may need a neurological exam if you have symptoms of a nervous system disorder. Symptoms vary depending on the disorder, but common symptoms include: Headache Problems with balance and/or coordination Numbness in the arms and/or legs Blurred vision Changes in hearing and/or your ability to smell Changes in behavior Slurred speech Confusion or other changes in mental ability Weakness Seizures Fatigue Fever1What happens during a neurological exam? A neurological exam is usually performed by a neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain and spinal cord. During the exam, your neurologist will test different functions of the nervous system. The types of tests will depend on your symptoms, but most neurological exams include tests of some or all of the following:  Mental status. Your neurologist or other provider will ask you general questions, such as the date, place, and time. You may also be asked to perform tasks. These may include remembering a list of items, naming objects, and drawing specific shapes. Coordination and balance. Your neurologist may ask you to walk in a straight line, placing one foot directly in front of the other. Other tests may include closing your eyes and touching your nose with your index finger. Reflexes. A reflex is an automatic response to stimulation. Reflexes are tested by tapping different areas of the body with a small rubber hammer. If reflexes are normal, your body will move a certain way when tapped with the hammer. During a neurological exam, the neurologist may tap several areas on your body, including below your kneecap and areas around your elbow and ankle. Sensation. Your neurologist will touch your legs, arms, and/or other body parts with different instruments. These may include a tuning fork, dull needle, and/or alcohol swabs. You will be asked to identify sensations such as heat, cold, and pain. Cranial nerves. These are the nerves that connect your brain with your eyes, ears, nose, face, tongue, neck, throat, upper shoulders, and some organs. You have 12 pairs of these nerves. Your neurologist will test specific nerves depending on your symptoms. Testing may include identifying certain smells, sticking out your tongue and trying to speak, and moving your head from side to side. You may also get hearing and vision tests. Autonomic nervous system. This is the system that controls basic functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. To test this system, your neurologist or other provider may check your blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate while you are sitting, standing, and/or lying down. Other tests may include checking your pupils in response to light and a test of your ability to sweat normally.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a neurological exam? You don't need any special preparations for a neurological exam.1Are there any risks to the exam? There is no risk to having a neurological exam.1What do the results mean? If results on any part of the exam were not normal, your neurologist will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis. These tests may include one or more of the following: Blood and/or urine tests Imaging tests such as an x-ray or MRI A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test. CSF is clear fluid that surrounds and cushions your brain and spinal cord. A CSF test takes a small sample of this fluid. Biopsy. This is a procedure that removes a small piece of tissue for further testing. Tests, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), which use small electric sensors to measure brain activity and nerve function If you have questions about your results, talk to your neurologist or other health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a neurological exam? Nervous system disorders and mental health problems can have similar or the same symptoms. That's because some behavioral symptoms can be signs of a nervous system disorder. If you had a mental health screening that was not normal, or if you notice changes in your behavior, your provider may recommend a neurological exam.1References Case Western Reserve School of Medicine [Internet].

A test called a urinalysis checks a sample of your urine (pee) to see if it has nitrites. Nitrites in urine may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are caused by different types of bacteria. Many of these types of bacteria change a normal chemical in your urine, called nitrates, into another chemical, called nitrites. So, if you have nitrites in your urine, it usually means that you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are one of the most common types of infections, especially in women. Most UTIs affect the bladder and urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body). Fortunately, most UTIs are not serious. They are usually treated with antibiotics. UTIs that aren't treated could spread to the kidneys, which can be serious. So, it's important to diagnose and treat UTIs early. Other names: urine test, urine analysis, microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine, UA1What is it used for? A urinalysis, which includes a test for nitrites in urine, is used to check your general health, including the health of your urinary tract and kidneys. It may also be used to check for a UTI.1Why do I need a nitrites in urine test? Your provider may order a urinalysis as part of a routine checkup or if you have symptoms of a UTI. Symptoms of a UTI may include: Frequent urges to urinate, even when you have little urine in your bladder Pain or burning when you urinate Dark, cloudy, or reddish colored urine Bad smelling urine Weakness, fatigue, or confusion, mainly in older people Fever, which may be a sign of a kidney infection If you have symptoms of a UTI, it's important to see your provider so you can start treatment right away, if needed.1What happens during a nitrites in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container being careful not to touch the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) should be separated and wiped from front to back on the inner sides.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) should be separated and wiped from front to back on the inner sides. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds, then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations to test for nitrites in urine. If your health care provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a nitrites in urine test.1What do the results mean? If there are nitrites in your urine, it may mean that you have a UTI. But, even if no nitrites are found, you may still have an infection. That's because some types of bacteria don't change nitrates into nitrites. Your provider will also look at other results of your urinalysis, especially tests that look for signs of white blood cells in your urine. White blood cells in urine may also mean you have a UTI. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a nitrites in urine test? At-home test kits for UTIs are available without a prescription. These test kits are also called urine dipstick tests or UTI test strips. They check for nitrites and white blood cells in your urine. At-home UTI tests are quick and easy to use, but they don't always provide accurate results. Your results may say you don't have a UTI when you really do. So, you may still need to see your provider for a nitrites in urine test. If you think you have a UTI, ask your provider which test is right for you. If you have signs of a UTI, your provider may order a urine culture test to see how much and what type of bacteria may be in your urine. This information helps your provider decide which type of antibiotic medicine to prescribe. In a urine culture test, bacteria from your urine are grown in a lab. Results usually take a couple of days. If a urinalysis is part of your regular checkup, your urine will be tested for several other substances. These include blood, proteins, acid and sugar levels, cell fragments, and crystals in your urine.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

A nonstress test is a safe, noninvasive test for pregnant women. Noninvasive means it doesn't cut into the skin or enter any part of the body. The test measures the heart rate of an unborn baby as the baby moves in the uterus. In most healthy babies, the heart rate, also known as the fetal heart rate, increases during movement. If your nonstress test results showed that the heart rate was not normal, it may mean that your baby is not getting enough oxygen. If this happens, you may need more testing or treatment, or in some cases, delivery may be induced.  Inducing labor is when a provider gives you medicine or uses other methods to start labor before it begins naturally. Other names: fetal nonstress test, NST1What is it used for? A nonstress test is used to check a baby's heart rate before birth. The test is usually done in the third trimester of pregnancy, most often between weeks 38 and 42.1Why do I need a nonstress test? Not all pregnant women need a nonstress test. But you may need this test if: Your baby doesn't seem to be moving as much as usual. You are overdue. You have a chronic medical condition such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or a clotting disorder. You had complications in a previous pregnancy. Your blood is Rh negative, a rare but potentially serious condition that causes your body to make antibodies to your baby's blood. You are having more than one baby (twins, triplets, or more).1What happens during a nonstress test? The test may be done in your provider's office or in a special prenatal area of a hospital. It generally includes the following steps: You will lie on a reclining chair or exam table. A health care provider will spread a special gel on the skin over your abdomen. Your provider will attach two belt-like devices around your abdomen. One will measure your baby's heartbeat. The other will record your contractions. Your provider will move the device over your abdomen until the baby's heartbeat is found. The baby's heart rate will be recorded on a monitor, while your contractions are recorded on paper. You may be asked to press a button on the device each time you feel your baby move. This allows your provider to record the heart rate during movement. The test usually lasts about 20 minutes. If your baby isn't active or moving during that time period, he or she may be asleep. To wake up the baby, your provider may place a small buzzer or other noisemaker over your abdomen. This won't harm the baby, but it may help a sleepy baby become more active. Your baby may also wake up if you have a snack or sugary drink. Your provider will remove the belts. He or she will likely review the results with you soon after the test. The procedure is very safe. It's called a "nonstress" test because no stress, or risk, is placed on the baby during the test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a nonstress test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to you or your baby from having a nonstress test.1What do the results mean? Nonstress test results are given as one of the following: Reactive or Reassuring. This means the baby's heart rate increased two or more times during the testing period. Nonreactive. This means the baby's heartbeat didn't increase when moving, or the baby wasn't moving much. A nonreactive result doesn't always mean your baby has a health problem. The baby may simply have been asleep and not easily awoken. Nonreactive results may also be caused by certain medicines taken during pregnancy. But if the result was nonreactive, your provider will probably take more tests to find out if there is cause for concern. If your baby is found to be at risk, you may need treatment or monitoring, or to have delivery induced if it is late enough in your pregnancy. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a nonstress test? Additional noninvasive tests for an unborn baby's heart rate include: Biophysical profile. This test combines a nonstress test with an ultrasound. An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture. The ultrasound checks your baby's breathing, muscle tone, and amniotic fluid level. Contraction stress test. This test checks for how your baby's heart reacts when your uterus contracts. To make your uterus contract, you may be asked to rub your nipples through your clothing or may be given a medicine called oxytocin, which can cause contractions. These tests pose no known risks to you or your baby.1References ACOG: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [Internet].

It's not just a matter of appearance. Obesity can put you at risk for a variety of chronic and serious health problems. These include: Heart disease Type 2 diabetes High blood pressure Arthritis Certain types of cancer Experts say obesity is major problem in the U.S. Today more than 30 percent of U.S. adults and 20 percent of U.S. children have obesity. Children with obesity are at risk for many of the same health problems as adults with obesity. An obesity screening may use a measurement called a BMI (body mass index) and other tests to find out if you or your child is overweight or has obesity. Being overweight means you have excess body weight. While not as severe as obesity, it may also lead to serious health problems.1What is a BMI? A BMI (body mass index) is a calculation based on your weight and height. While it's hard to directly measure fat on the body, a BMI can provide a good estimate. To measure BMI, your health care provider may use an online tool or an equation that uses your weight and height information. You can measure your own BMI in much the same way by using an online BMI calculator. Your results will fall into one of these categories: Below 18.5: Underweight 18.5-24.9: Healthy weight 25 -29.9: Overweight 30 and above: Obese 40 or higher: Severely obese, also known as morbidly obese BMI is also used to diagnose obesity in children, but it is figured out differently than in adults. Your child's health care provider will calculate BMI based on your child's age, sex, weight, and height. He or she will compare those numbers with the results of other children with similar characteristics. The results will be in the form of a percentile. A percentile is a type of comparison between an individual and a group. For example, if your child has a BMI in the 50th percentile, it means 50 percent of children of the same age and sex have a lower BMI, and 50 percent will have a higher BMI. Your child's BMI will show one of the following results: Less than the 5th percentile: Underweight 5th-84th percentile: Normal Weight 85th-94th percentile: Overweight 95th percentile and higher: Obese1What causes obesity? Obesity happens when you take in more calories than your body needs over a long period of time. A variety of factors can lead to obesity. For many people, dieting and willpower alone are not enough to control weight. Obesity may be caused by one or more of the following: Diet. You are at a higher risk of obesity if your diet includes a lot of fast foods, packaged snacks, and sugary soft drinks. Lack of exercise. If you don't get enough physical activity to burn off what you eat, you will likely gain weight. Family history. You're more likely to become obese if close family members have obesity. Aging. As you get older, your muscle tissue decreases and your metabolism slows down. This can lead to weight gain, and eventually obesity, even if you stayed at a healthy weight when you were younger. Pregnancy. It's normal and healthy to gain weight during pregnancy. But if you don't lose the weight after pregnancy, it can cause long-term weight problems. Menopause. Many women gain weight after menopause. This may be caused by changes in hormone levels and/or reduction in daily activities. Biology. Our bodies have systems that help keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system doesn't work right. This makes it especially hard to lose weight. Hormonal disorders. Certain disorders cause your body to make too much or too little of important hormones. This may lead to weight gain, and sometimes obesity.1What is an obesity screening used for? An obesity screening is used to find out if you or your child is at an unhealthy weight. If the screening shows that you or your child is overweight or has obesity, your provider will check to see if there is medical issue causing the excess weight. Your provider will also teach you about what you can do to reduce your weight and improve your health.1Why do I need obesity screening? Most adults and children over the age of 6 should be screened at least once a year with a BMI. If your health care provider finds that you have a high or increasing BMI, he or she can recommend steps you can take to help prevent you from becoming overweight or obese.1What happens during an obesity screening? In addition to a BMI, an obesity screening may include: A physical exam A measurement around your waist. Excess fat around the waist can put you at an even higher risk for obesity-related health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Blood tests to check for diabetes and/or medical conditions that may be causing weight gain.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for an obesity screening? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for certain types of blood tests. Your health care provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the screening? There is no risk to having a BMI or a waist measurement. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The results of your BMI and waist measurement may show that you are in one of the following categories: Underweight Healthy weight Overweight Obese Severely obese Your blood tests may show whether you have a hormonal disorder. Blood tests may also show if you have or are at risk for diabetes.1Is there anything else I should know about an obesity screening? If your results show that you or your child is overweight or obese, talk to your health care provider about treatment options. There are many ways to treat obesity. Treatment will depend on the cause of the weight problem and how much weight loss is recommended. Options may include: Eating a healthier, lower calorie diet Getting more exercise Behavioral help from a mental health counselor and/or support group Prescription weight loss medicines Weight loss surgery. This surgery, also called bariatric surgery, makes changes to your digestive system. This limits the amount of food you are able to eat. It's only used for people with severe obesity and who have tried other weight loss methods that haven't worked.1References AHRQ: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [Internet].

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326119 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Test : 1What is an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) test? Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder. It causes repeated unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions). To get rid of obsessions, people with OCD may perform certain actions over and over again (compulsions). Most people with OCD know that their compulsions don't make sense, but still can't stop doing them. Sometimes they feel these behaviors are the only way to prevent something bad from happening. Compulsions may temporarily relieve anxiety. OCD is different than regular habits and routines. It's not unusual to brush your teeth at the same time every morning or sit in the same chair for dinner every night. With OCD, compulsive behaviors can take up several hours a day. They can get in the way of normal daily life. OCD usually starts in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Researchers don't know what causes OCD. But many believe genetics and/or a problem with chemicals in the brain may play a role. It often runs in families. An OCD test can help diagnose the disorder so you can get treated. Treatment can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. Other names: OCD screening1What is it used for? This test is used to find out if certain symptoms are being caused by OCD.1Why do I need an OCD test? This test may be done if you or your child is having obsessive thoughts and/or showing compulsive behaviors.  Common obsessions include: Fear of dirt or germs Fear that harm will come to yourself or your loved ones An overwhelming need for neatness and order Constant worries that you've left something undone, like left the stove on or door unlocked Common compulsions include: Repeated hand washing. Some people with OCD wash their hands more than 100 times a day. Checking and rechecking that appliances and lights are turned off Repeating certain actions such as sitting down and getting up from a chair Constantly cleaning Frequently checking buttons and zippers on clothing1What happens during an OCD test? Your primary care provider may give you a physical exam and order blood tests to find out if your symptoms are being caused by certain medicines, another mental illness, or other physical disorders. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. You may be tested by a mental health provider in addition to or instead of your primary care provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. If you are being tested by a mental health provider, he or she may ask you detailed questions about your thoughts and behaviors.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for an OCD test? You don't need any special preparations for an OCD test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to having a physical exam or an exam by a mental health provider. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider may use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) to help make a diagnosis. The DSM-5 (fifth edition of the DSM) is a book published by the American Psychiatric Association. It provides guidelines for diagnosing mental health conditions. The DSM-5 defines OCD as obsessions and/or compulsions that: Take up an hour a day or more Interfere with personal relationships, work, and other important parts of daily life The guidelines also include the following symptoms and behaviors. Symptoms of obsession include: Repeated unwanted thoughts Trouble stopping those thoughts Compulsive behaviors include: Repetitive behaviors such as hand washing or counting Behaviors done to reduce anxiety and/or prevent something bad from happening Treatment for OCD usually includes one or both of the following: Psychological counseling Antidepressants Several new options for treating OCD are currently being studied. Talk to your provider to learn more, including when or if they will become available.1Is there anything else I need to know about an OCD test? If you are diagnosed with OCD, your provider may refer you to a mental health provider for treatment. There are many types of providers who treat mental health disorders. Some specialize in OCD. The most common types of mental health providers include: Psychiatrist , a medical doctor who specializes in mental health. Psychiatrists diagnose and treat mental health disorders. They can also prescribe medicine. Psychologist , a professional trained in psychology. Psychologists generally have doctoral degrees. But they do not have medical degrees. Psychologists diagnose and treat mental health disorders. They offer one-on-one counseling and/or group therapy sessions. They can't prescribe medicine unless they have a special license. Some psychologists work with providers who are able to prescribe medicine. Licensed clinical social worker (L.C.S.W.) has a master's degree in social work with training in mental health. Some have additional degrees and training. L.C.S.W.s diagnose and provide counseling for a variety of mental health problems. They can't prescribe medicine but can work with providers who are able to. Licensed professional counselor. (L.P.C.). Most L.P.C.s have a master's degree. But training requirements vary by state. L.P.C.s diagnose and provide counseling for a variety of mental health problems. They can't prescribe medicine but can work with providers who are able to. Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are specially trained nurses who have a master’s or doctoral degree in psychiatric nursing. They assess, diagnose, and treat a variety of mental health disorders. Some ARPNs can prescribe medicines. L.C.S.W.s and L.P.C.s may be known by other names, including therapist, clinician, or counselor. To find a mental health provider who can best treat your OCD, talk to your primary care provider.1References American Psychiatric Nurses Association [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw169097   Opioid Testing : 1What is opioid testing? Opioid testing looks for the presence of opioids in urine, blood, or saliva. Opioids are powerful drugs that are used to relieve pain. They are often prescribed to help treat serious injuries or illnesses. In addition to reducing pain, opioids can also increase feelings of pleasure and well-being. Once an opioid dose wears off, it's natural to want those feelings to return. So even using opioids as prescribed by a doctor can lead to dependence and addiction. The terms "opioids" and "opiates" are often used in the same way. An opiate is a type of opioid that comes naturally from the opium poppy plant. Opiates include the medicines codeine and morphine, as well as the illegal drug heroin. Other opioids are synthetic (man-made) or part synthetic (part natural and part man-made). Both types are designed to produce effects similar to a naturally occurring opiate. These types of opioids include: Oxycodone (OxyContin®) Hydrocodone (Vicodin®) Hydromorphone Oxymorphone Methadone Fentanyl. Drug dealers sometimes add fentanyl to heroin. This combination of drugs is especially dangerous. Opioids are often misused, leading to overdoses and death. In the United States, tens of thousands of people die every year from opioid overdoses. Opioid testing can help prevent or treat addiction before it becomes dangerous. Other names: opioid screening, opiate screening, opiate testing1What is it used for? Opioid testing is often used to monitor people who are taking prescription opioids. The test helps ensure you are taking the right amount of medicine. Opioid testing may also be included as part of an overall drug screening. These screenings test for a variety of drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, as well as opioids. Drug screenings may be used for: Employment. Employers may test you before and/or after hiring to check for on-the-job drug use. Legal or forensic purposes. Testing may be part of a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation. Drug screening may also be ordered as part of a court case.1Why do I need opioid testing? You may need opioid testing if you are currently taking prescription opioids to treat chronic pain or another medical condition. The tests can tell if you are taking more medicine than you should, which can be a sign of addiction. You may also be asked to take a drug screening, which includes tests for opioids, as a condition of your employment or as part of a police investigation or court case. Your health care provider may also order opioid testing if you have symptoms of opioid abuse or overdose. Symptoms may start as lifestyle changes, such as: Lack of hygiene Isolation from family and friends Stealing from family, friends, or businesses Financial difficulties If opioid abuse continues, physical symptoms may include: Slowed or slurred speech Difficulty breathing Dilated or small pupils Delirium Nausea and vomiting Drowsiness Agitation Changes in blood pressure or heart rhythm1What happens during an opioid test? Most opioid tests require that you give a urine sample. You will be given instructions to provide a "clean catch" sample. During a clean catch urine test, you will: Wash your hands Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back. Start to urinate into the toilet. Move the collection container under your urine stream. Pass at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts. Finish urinating into the toilet. Return the sample container to the lab technician or health care provider. In certain instances, a medical technician or other staff member may need to be present while you provide your sample. Other opioid tests require you to give samples of your blood or saliva. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. During a saliva test: A health care provider will use a swab or absorbent pad to collect saliva from the inside of your cheek. The swab or pad will stay in your cheek for a few minutes to allow saliva to build up. Some providers may ask you to spit into a tube, rather than swabbing inside your cheek.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Be sure to tell the testing provider or your health care provider if you are taking any prescription or over-the-counter medicines. Some of these may cause positive results for opioids. Poppy seeds can also cause a positive opioid result. So you should avoid foods with poppy seeds for up to three days before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a urine or saliva test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Although physical risks to testing are very small, a positive result on an opioid test may affect other aspects of your life, including your job or the outcome of a court case.1What do the results mean? If your results are negative, it means no opioids were found in your body, or that you are taking the right amount of opioids for your health condition. But if you have symptoms of opioid abuse, your provider will probably order more tests. If your results are positive, it may mean that there are opioids in your system. If high levels of opioids are found, it may mean you are taking too much of a prescribed medicine or otherwise abusing drugs. False positives are possible, so your health care provider may order more tests to confirm a positive result. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about opioid testing? If your results show unhealthy opioid levels, it's important to get treatment. Opioid addiction can be deadly. If you are being treated for chronic pain, work with your health care provider to find ways to manage pain that don't include opioids. Treatments for anyone who is abusing opioids may include: Medicines Rehabilitation programs on an inpatient or outpatient basis Ongoing psychological counseling Support groups1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://www.uwhealth.org/health/topic/medicaltest/toxicology/hw27448.html#hw27451 Osmolality Tests : 1What are osmolality tests? Osmolality tests measure the amount of certain substances in blood, urine, or stool. These include glucose (sugar), urea (a waste product made in the liver), and several electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals. They help control the amount of fluids in your body. The test can show whether you have an unhealthy balance of fluids in your body. An unhealthy fluid balance can be caused by many different conditions. These include excess salt intake, kidney disease, heart disease, and some types of poisoning. Other names: serum osmolality, plasma osmolality urine osmolality, stool osmolality, osmotic gap1What are they used for? Osmolality tests may be used for a variety of reasons. A blood osmolality test, also known as a serum osmolality test, is most often used to: Check the balance between water and certain chemicals in the blood. Find out if you have swallowed a poison such as antifreeze or rubbing alcohol Help diagnose dehydration, a condition in which your body loses too much fluid Help diagnose overhydration, a condition in which your body retains too much fluid Help diagnose diabetes insipidus, a condition that affects the kidneys and can lead to dehydration Sometimes blood plasma is also tested for osmolality. Serum and plasma are both parts of the blood. Plasma contains substances including blood cells and certain proteins. Serum is a clear fluid that does not contain these substances. A urine osmolality test is often used along with a serum osmolality test to check the body's fluid balance. The urine test may also be used to find out the reason for increased or decreased urination. A stool osmolality test is most often used to find out the reason for chronic diarrhea that is not caused by a bacterial or parasitic infection.1Why do I need an osmolality test? You may need a serum osmolality or urine osmolality test if you have symptoms of a fluid imbalance, diabetes insipidus, or certain types of poisoning. Symptoms of a fluid imbalance and diabetes insipidus are similar and may include: Excessive thirst (if dehydrated) Nausea and vomiting Headache Confusion Fatigue Seizures Symptoms of poisoning will be different depending on the type of the substance that was swallowed, but may include: Nausea and vomiting Convulsions, a condition that causes uncontrollable shaking of your muscles Difficulty breathing Slurred speech You may also need a urine osmolality if you have trouble urinating or are urinating too much. You may need a stool osmolality test if you have chronic diarrhea that can't be explained by a bacterial or parasitic infection or another cause such as intestinal damage.1What happens during an osmolality test? During a blood test (serum osmolality or plasma osmolality): A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. During a urine osmolality test: Your health care provider will need to collect a sample of your urine. You will receive a container to collect the urine and special instructions to make sure that the sample is sterile. These instructions are often called the "clean catch method." The clean catch method includes the following steps: Wash your hands. Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back. Start to urinate into the toilet. Move the collection container under your urine stream. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts. Finish urinating into the toilet. Return the sample container to your health care provider. During a stool osmolality test: You will need to provide a stool sample. Your provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following: Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves. Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab. You may get a device or applicator to help you collect the sample. Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample. Seal and label the container. Remove the gloves and wash your hands. Return the container to your health care provider or the lab as soon as possible. If you think you may have trouble delivering your sample in time, talk to your health care provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 6 hours before the test or limit fluids 12 to 14 hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to osmolality tests?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a urine or stool test.1What do the results mean? If your serum osmolality results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Antifreeze or other type of poisoning Dehydration or overhydration Too much or too little salt in the blood Diabetes insipidus Stroke If your urine osmolality results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Dehydration or overhydration Heart failure Liver disease Kidney disease If your stool osmolality results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Factitious diarrhea, a condition caused by overuse of laxatives Malabsorption, a condition that affects your ability to digest and take in nutrients from food If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.  Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about osmolality tests? Your health care provider may order more tests along with or after your osmolality test. These may include: Complete blood count (CBC) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test Blood glucose test Electrolyte panel Albumin blood test Fecal occult blood test (FOBT)1References Clinical Lab Manger [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw6580 Ova and Parasite Test : 1What is an ova and parasite test? An ova and parasite test looks for parasites and their eggs (ova) in a sample of your stool. A parasite is a tiny plant or animal that gets nutrients by living off another creature. Parasites can live in your digestive system and cause illness. These are known as intestinal parasites. Intestinal parasites affect tens of millions of people around the world. They are more common in countries where sanitation is poor, but millions of people in the United States get infected every year. The most common types of parasites in the U.S. include giardia and cryptosporidium, often referred to as crypto. These parasites are commonly found in: Rivers, lakes, and streams, even in those that appear clean Swimming pools and hot tubs Surfaces such as bathroom handles and faucets, diaper changing tables, and toys. These surfaces may contain traces of stool from an infected person. Food Soil Many people get infected with an intestinal parasite when they accidentally swallow contaminated water or take a drink from a lake or stream. Children at day care centers are also at higher risk for infection. Children may pick up the parasite by touching an infected surface and putting their fingers in their mouths. Fortunately, most parasite infections go away on their own or are easily treated. But a parasite infection can cause serious complications in people with weakened immune systems. Your immune system may be weakened by HIV/AIDS, cancer, or other disorders. Infants and older adults also have weaker immune systems. Other names: parasitic examination (stool), stool sample exam, stool O&P, fecal smear1What is it used for? An ova and parasite test is used to find out if parasites are infecting your digestive system. If you've already been diagnosed with a parasite infection, the test may be used to see if your treatment is working.1Why do I need an ova and parasite test? Your health care provider may order tests if you or your child has symptoms of an intestinal parasite. These include: Diarrhea that lasts for more than a few days Abdominal pain Blood and/or mucus in the stool Nausea and vomiting Gas Fever Weight loss Sometimes these symptoms go away without treatment, and testing is not needed. But testing may be ordered if you or your child has symptoms of a parasite infection and are at higher risk for complications. Risk factors include: Age. Infants and older adults have weaker immune systems. This can make infections more dangerous. Illness. Certain illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and cancer can weaken the immune system. Certain medicines. Some medical conditions are treated with drugs that suppress the immune system. This can make a parasite infection more serious. Worsening symptoms. If your symptoms don't improve over time, you may need medicine or other treatment.1What happens during an ova and parasite test? You will need to provide a sample of your stool. Your provider or your child's provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following: Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves. Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab. If you have diarrhea, you can tape a large plastic bag to the toilet seat. It may be easier to collect your stool this way. You will then put the bag into the container. Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample. Seal and label the container. Remove the gloves, and wash your hands. Return the container to your health care provider as soon as possible. Parasites may be harder to find when stool is not tested quickly enough. If you are unable to get to your provider right away, you should refrigerate your sample until you are ready deliver it. If you need to collect a sample from a baby, you will need to: Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves. Line the baby's diaper with plastic wrap Position the wrap to help prevent urine and stool from mixing together. Place the plastic wrapped sample in a special container given to you by your child's provider. Remove the gloves, and wash your hands. Return the container to the provider as soon as possible. If you are unable to get to your provider right away, you should refrigerate your sample until you are ready deliver it. You may need to collect several stool samples from yourself or your child over a period of a few days. This is because parasites may not be detected in every sample. Multiple samples increase the chance the parasites will be found.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an ova and parasite test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having an ova and parasite test.1What do the results mean? A negative result means no parasites were found. This can mean you don't have a parasite infection or there were not enough parasites to be detected. Your health care provider may retest and/or order different tests to help make a diagnosis. A positive result means you've been infected with a parasite. The results will also show the type and number of parasites you have. Treatment for an intestinal parasite infection almost always includes drinking plenty of fluids. This is because diarrhea and vomiting can cause dehydration (the loss of too much fluid from your body). Treatment may also include medicines that get rid of the parasites and/or relieve symptoms. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an ova and parasite test? There are steps you can take to help prevent a parasite infection. They include: Always wash your hands after going to the bathroom, changing a diaper, and before handling food. Don't drink water from lakes, streams, or rivers, unless you know for sure it has been treated. When camping or traveling to certain countries where the water supply may not be safe, avoid tap water, ice, and uncooked foods washed with tap water. Bottled water is safe. If you are unsure if water is safe, boil it before drinking. Boiling water for one to three minutes will kill the parasites. Wait until the water cools before drinking.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Panic disorder is a condition in which you have frequent panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear and anxiety. In addition to emotional distress, a panic attack can cause physical symptoms. These include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, and shortness of breath. During a panic attack, some people think they are having a heart attack. A panic attack can last anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour. Some panic attacks happen in response to a stressful or scary situation, such as a car accident. Other attacks happen without a clear reason. Panic attacks are common, affecting at least 11% of adults each year. Many people have one or two attacks in their lifetime and recover without treatment. But if you have repeated, unexpected panic attacks and are in constant fear of getting a panic attack, you may have panic disorder. Panic disorder is rare. It only affects 2 to 3 percent of adults each year. It's twice as common in women than in men. While panic disorder is not life-threatening, it can be upsetting and affect your quality of life. If left untreated, it can lead to other serious problems, including depression and substance use. A panic disorder test can help diagnose the condition so you can get the right treatment.  Other names: panic disorder screening1What is it used for? A panic disorder test is used to find out if certain symptoms are caused by panic disorder or a physical condition, such as a heart attack.1Why do I need a panic disorder test? You may need a panic disorder test if you've had two or more recent panic attacks for no clear reason and are afraid of having more panic attacks. Symptoms of a panic attack include: Pounding heartbeat Chest pain Shortness of breath Sweating Dizziness Trembling Chills Nausea Intense fear or anxiety Fear of losing control Fear of dying1What happens during a panic disorder test? Your primary care provider may give you a physical exam and ask you about your feelings, mood, behavior patterns, and other symptoms. Your provider may also order blood tests and/or tests on your heart to rule out a heart attack or other physical conditions. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. You may be tested by a mental health provider in addition to or instead of your primary care provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional that specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. If you are being tested by a mental health provider, he or she may ask you more detailed questions about your feelings and behaviors. You may also be asked to fill out a questionnaire about these issues.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a panic disorder test? You don't need any special preparations for a panic disorder test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to having a physical exam or filling out a questionnaire. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider may use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) to help make a diagnosis. The DSM-5 (fifth edition of the DSM) is a book published by the American Psychiatric Association that provides guidelines for diagnosing mental health conditions. DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing panic disorder include: Frequent, unexpected panic attacks Ongoing worry about having another panic attack Fear of losing control No other cause of a panic attack, such as drug use or a physical disorder Treatment for panic disorder usually includes one or both of the following: Psychological counseling Anti-anxiety or antidepressant medicines1Is there anything else I need to know about a panic disorder test? If you are diagnosed with panic disorder, your provider may refer you to a mental health provider for treatment. There are many types of providers who treat mental disorders. The most common types of mental health providers include: Psychiatrist, a medical doctor who specializes in mental health. Psychiatrists diagnose and treat mental health disorders. They can also prescribe medicine. Psychologist, a professional trained in psychology. Psychologists generally have doctoral degrees. But they do not have medical degrees. Psychologists diagnose and treat mental health disorders. They offer one-on-one counseling and/or group therapy sessions. They can't prescribe medicine unless they have a special license. Some psychologists work with providers who are able to prescribe medicine. Licensed clinical social worker (L.C.S.W.) has a master's degree in social work with training in mental health. Some have additional degrees and training. L.C.S.W.s diagnose and provide counseling for a variety of mental health problems. They can't prescribe medicine but can work with providers who are able to. Licensed professional counselor. (L.P.C.). Most L.P.C.s have a master's degree. But training requirements vary by state. L.P.C.s diagnose and provide counseling for a variety of mental health problems. They can't prescribe medicine but can work with providers who are able to. Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are specially trained nurses who have a master’s or doctoral degree in psychiatric nursing. They assess, diagnose, and treat a variety of mental health disorders. Some ARPNs can prescribe medicines. C.S.W.s and L.P.C.s may be known by other names, including therapist, clinician, or counselor. If you don't know which type of mental health provider you should see, talk to your primary care provider.1References American Psychiatric Nurses Association [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw53796 Pap Smear : 1What is a Pap Smear? A Pap smear is a test to help prevent cervical cancer or find it early. The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina. During a Pap smear, a health care provider collects cells from the cervix and sends them to a lab. At the lab, the cells are checked under a microscope for cancer or for signs that they may become cancer. Cells that may become cancer are called precancers. Finding and treating precancers can help prevent cervical cancer. The Pap smear is also a reliable way to find cancer early when it's easier to treat. Other names for a Pap smear: Pap test, cervical cytology, Papanicolaou test, Pap smear test, vaginal smear technique1What is it used for? A Pap smear looks for abnormal changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Sometimes the cells collected during a Pap smear are also checked for HPV, a virus that can cause cell changes that may lead to cancer. Pap smears and HPV tests are cervical cancer screening tests that look for cancer before you have any symptoms. Research shows that cervical cancer screening can greatly reduce the number of new cervical cancer cases and deaths from the disease. Ask your provider which test is right for you or if you should have both a Pap smear and an HPV test.1How often do I need a Pap smear? In general, if you're between age 21 and 65, you should have regular Pap smears: If you're between ages 21 and 29 and your last Pap test result was normal, your provider may say you can wait three years until your next test. If you're between ages 30 and 65 and your last Pap smear result was normal:


Your provider may say you can wait three years until your next test.
If you also had a normal HPV test result, your provider may say that you can wait five years until your next test.

 Your provider may say you can wait three years until your next test. If you also had a normal HPV test result, your provider may say that you can wait five years until your next test. If you're over age 65, your provider may tell you that you don't need Pap smears anymore if you:


Have had normal Pap smears for several years.
Have had surgery to remove your uterus and cervix because you had a condition that was not cancer, such as fibroids.

 Have had normal Pap smears for several years. Have had surgery to remove your uterus and cervix because you had a condition that was not cancer, such as fibroids. If you have a higher risk for developing cervical cancer, your provider may recommend screening more often or after age 65. You may have a higher risk if you: Had an abnormal Pap smear in the past Have HIV Have a weakened immune system Were exposed to a drug called DES (Diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between the years 1940–1971, DES was prescribed during pregnancy to prevent miscarriages. It was later linked to an increased risk of certain cancers in the female children exposed to it during the pregnancy. If you're under age 21, cervical cancer screening is not recommended. Your risk of cervical cancer is very low. Also, any changes in cervical cells are likely to go away on their own. If you are unsure whether you need a Pap smear, talk with your provider.1What happens during a Pap smear? During a Pap smear you will lie on an exam table. Your provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to widen the vagina, so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a small, soft brush or swab to collect cells from the cervix. The cell sample is sent to a lab for testing. A Pap smear is often done as part of a pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your provider examines your uterus, ovaries, and genital area. But a pelvic exam doesn't always include a Pap smear. So, when you have a pelvic exam, ask your provider whether you'll have a Pap smear, too.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You should not have a Pap smear while you are having your period. A good time to have the test is about five days after the last day of your period.  For two to three days before your test, you should not: Use tampons Use birth control foam, jelly, or cream Use other creams or medicines in the vagina Douche (rinse the vagina with water or other fluid) Have vaginal sex1Are there any risks to the test? You may feel some mild discomfort during a Pap smear. Afterwards, you may have some very light bleeding. But there are no known risks to having a Pap smear.1What do the results mean? A Pap smear test has three possible results: Normal Pap smear or "negative" result. No abnormal changes were found in the cells of your cervix. Your provider may tell you that you can wait three years for your next test. If you also had a normal HPV test result, you may be able to wait five years for your next test, depending on your age and medical history. Unclear or unsatisfactory results. The lab sample may not have had enough cells, or the cells may have been clumped together or hidden by mucus. Your provider will usually ask you to come in for another test in 2 to 4 months. Abnormal Pap smear or "positive" result. Abnormal changes were found in your cervical cells. Most of the time, abnormal results do not mean you have cervical cancer. Minor changes in the cells usually go back to normal on their own. But your provider may recommend a follow-up test to check.  More serious cell changes may turn into cancer if they are not removed. Finding and treating these cells early can help prevent cancer from developing. Talk with your health care provider to learn what your Pap smear results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a Pap smear? Thousands of women in the U.S. die from cervical cancer every year. A Pap smear, along with an HPV test, is one of the most effective ways to prevent cervical cancer.1References American Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: American Cancer Society Inc.; c2022.

Parainfluenza viruses are a group of four types of viruses. They are a common cause of respiratory (breathing) illnesses. These illnesses can affect your, nose, throat, lungs, and bronchial tubes (the airways that carry air to your lungs).  Parainfluenza tests check whether a parainfluenza virus is causing an illness. The tests usually use a sample of fluid from your nose or mucus from your lungs. Parainfluenza viruses are also called human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs). They aren't the same as flu (influenza) viruses. The flu is more common in winter. In the U.S., parainfluenza viruses are more common in the spring, summer, and fall. Like the flu, parainfluenza spreads easily from person to person. It can spread through the air when a person with the infection coughs or sneezes. You can also get the flu by touching a surface that has the flu virus on it, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Parainfluenza viruses commonly cause respiratory illness in babies and younger children, but anyone can get sick from these viruses. You can also have parainfluenza illnesses many times in your life. If you're healthy, you'll probably have mild symptoms that are much like a common cold, such a runny nose, fever, or cough. And you'll usually get better on your own. Older adults and people of all ages who have weakened immune systems are more likely to develop more serious illness from parainfluenza infections. These illnesses include croup, bronchitis, and pneumonia. The most common test for parainfluenza viruses is a molecular test, such as a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests. These tests can find very small amounts of genetic material from parainfluenza viruses in the fluid sample from your nose or lungs. Other tests for parainfluenza virus are used less often than molecular tests. Rapid antigen tests are less accurate and must be done within a week after symptoms begin. Viral culture tests take much longer than other tests. And blood tests are mainly used for research. Other names: human  parainfluenza virus test; HPIV test; HPIV-1 test; HPIV-2 test, HPIV-3 test; paraflu 1-4 PCR; parainfluenza 1-4 by PCR; parainfluenza PCR panel; PIV1What is it used for? Most healthy people who have symptoms of a respiratory illness do not need parainfluenza testing. That's because they usually get better on their own. But you may need this test if you have a high risk of getting seriously ill from a parainfluenza infection because you: Have a condition that affects your immune system, such as:

Blood stem cell or bone marrow transplants
Organ transplantation
Blood cancers
HIV

 Blood stem cell or bone marrow transplants Organ transplantation Blood cancers HIV Have a heart or lung disorder Are in the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia (pneumonia that you catch during your usual daily life, not from spending time in a hospital or other health facility) Are an older adult For these people, treatment decisions depend on knowing whether they have a viral or bacterial infection. So, parainfluenza testing may be done as part of a respiratory pathogens panel.  This is a group of tests that checks for several viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory illnesses. There is no cure for parainfluenza viruses, but bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics.1Why do I need a parainfluenza test? You or your child may need a parainfluenza test if either of you have: Symptoms of a respiratory illness. And another condition that increases your risk of getting seriously sick from a parainfluenza illness. Symptoms of parainfluenza and other respiratory illnesses may include: Fever Sore throat Wheezing A long-lasting cough that may sound like a barking in children (croup) Shortness of breath Too much mucus in the lungs or airways (congestion) Rapid breathing1What happens during a parainfluenza test? Tests to diagnose parainfluenza viruses are usually done on a sample of fluid from your nose or chest. A sample from your nose may be used if you've had symptoms between 3 and 7 days. Most tests are done with this type of sample. The sample may be collected using one of these methods: Nasal aspirate or wash. To do a nasal aspirate, a health care professional will insert a saline solution (salt water) into your nose and remove it with gentle suction. Swab test. A health care professional will use a special swab to take a sample from either:


Deep in the back of your nose
An inch deep inside both of your nostrils and from your throat using a separate swab inserted through your mouth

 Deep in the back of your nose An inch deep inside both of your nostrils and from your throat using a separate swab inserted through your mouth A sample from your chest may be used at any time during your illness. The fluid may be collected with one of these methods: Sputum test. Sputum is a thick mucus from the lungs. It is different from saliva (spit). To get a sample, you will be asked to cough up sputum into a special container. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). A BAL collects a sample of fluid from your lung. This type of sample is usually used only if you are very ill. A doctor will insert a narrow, flexible tube (a bronchoscope) down your throat and into your lung. A small amount of salt water will be injected through the tube into your lung and then suctioned out. Numbing medicine will be used in your mouth and throat. You may also have medicine to help you relax.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you have a BAL, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. You should plan to have someone take you home because you may feel sleepy if you are given medicine to relax. You don't need any special preparations for other parainfluenza tests.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a parainfluenza test: A nasal aspirate or wash may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary. Nasal and throat swabs may cause a brief gagging feeling. A BAL may cause a sore throat for a few days. Serious problems are rare. They include bleeding in the airways, infection, or a partly collapsed lung.1What do the results mean? A negative result means that no signs of parainfluenza viruses were found in your sample. Another illness is probably causing your symptoms. But a negative test result doesn't rule out a parainfluenza illness. It's possible that there was too little virus in your sample for the test to find. A positive result means that you likely have a parainfluenza infection. But it's possible for a PCR test to show signs of a virus even though you don't have enough virus in your body to make you sick. Talk with your provider about what your test results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Branche AR, Falsey AR. Parainfluenza Virus Infection.

This test measures the level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood. PTH, also known as parathormone, is made by your parathyroid glands. These are four pea-sized glands in your neck. PTH controls the level of calcium in the blood. Calcium is a mineral that keeps your bones and teeth healthy and strong. It's also essential for the proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart. If calcium blood levels are too low, your parathyroid glands will release PTH into the blood. This causes calcium levels to rise. If calcium blood levels are too high, these glands will stop making PTH. PTH levels that are too high or too low can cause serious health problems. Other names: parathormone, intact PTH1What is it used for? A PTH test is most often used along with calcium testing to: Diagnose hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone Diagnose hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too little parathyroid hormone Find out whether abnormal calcium levels are being caused by a problem with your parathyroid glands Monitor kidney disease1Why do I need a PTH test? You may need a PTH test if your results were not normal on a previous calcium test. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of having too much or too little calcium in your blood. Symptoms of too much calcium include: Bones that break easily More frequent urination Increased thirst Nausea and vomiting Fatigue Kidney stones Symptoms of too little calcium include: Tingling in your fingers and/or toes Muscle cramps Irregular heartbeat1What happens during a PTH test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You probably won't need any special preparations for a PTH test, but check with your health care provider. Some providers may ask you to fast (not eat or drink) before your test, or may want you to take the test at a certain time of day.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your test shows you have a higher than normal level of PTH, it may mean you have: Hyperparathyroidism A benign (noncancerous) tumor of the parathyroid gland Kidney disease A vitamin D deficiency A disorder that makes you unable to absorb calcium from food If your test shows you have a lower than normal level of PTH, it may mean you have: Hypoparathyroidism An overdose of vitamin D or calcium If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a PTH test? PTH also plays an important role in controlling the levels of phosphorus and vitamin D in the blood. If your PTH test results were not normal, your provider may order phosphorus and/or vitamin D tests to help make a diagnosis.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

A partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test uses a blood sample to measure how long it takes for your blood to make a clot. Normally, when you get a cut or injury that causes bleeding, many different types of proteins in your blood work together to make a clot to stop the bleeding. These proteins are called coagulation factors or clotting factors. If any of your clotting factors are missing, at a low level, or not working properly, your blood may: Clot too slowly after an injury or surgery. If this happens, you have a bleeding disorder. Bleeding disorders can cause serious blood loss. Hemophilia is one type of bleeding disorder. Clot too much and/or too quickly, even without an injury. This condition may lead to clots that block your blood flow and cause serious conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, or clots in the lungs. A PTT test helps check a specific group of clotting factors. It helps show how much of these clotting factors you have and how well they're working. A PTT test is often done with other tests that check clotting factors and how well they all work together. Other names: activated partial thromboplastin time, aPTT, intrinsic pathway coagulation factor profile1What is it used for? A PTT test is used to check for problems with a specific group of blood clotting factors. The test is done to: Find the cause of too much bruising or bleeding. Find the cause of clotting problems. Causes can include certain autoimmune diseases such as lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Monitor people taking heparin, a type of medicine that's used to prevent and treat blood clots. PTT testing can help make sure the dose is safe and effective. Check the risk for possible bleeding problems before surgery or medical procedures. (A PTT test is not always used as a routine test before surgery. It may be used for certain people who may have a risk for bleeding problems).1Why do I need a PTT test? You may need a PTT test if you: Have problems with bleeding or bruising and the cause is not known Have a blood clot in a vein or artery Have liver disease (your liver makes most of your clotting factors). Have had several miscarriages Have been diagnosed with a bleeding or clotting disorder and don't know which clotting factors are involved Are taking heparin (to check how this medicine is affecting you, your health care provider may use a PTT test or another test instead).1What happens during a PTT test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a PTT test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your PTT test results will show how much time it took for your blood to clot. Results are usually given as a number of seconds. A PTT test is often ordered along with another blood test called a prothrombin time (PT) test. A PT test measures other clotting factors that a PTT test doesn't check. Your provider will usually compare the results of both tests to understand how your blood is clotting. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean for your health. In general, if your blood took longer than normal to clot on a PTT test, it may be a sign of: Liver disease. A lack of vitamin K. Certain genetic disorders that you inherit from your parents. These disorders affect certain clotting factors and increase your risk of bleeding. They include:

Von Willebrand disease.
Hemophilia.

 Von Willebrand disease. Hemophilia. Too much heparin. Certain types of leukemia. Autoimmune diseases, such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or lupus anticoagulant syndrome. These diseases cause your body to make proteins called antibodies. The antibodies related to these diseases cause too much clotting. But the results of a PTT test may show a slow clotting time. That's because the chemicals in the PTT test react with the antibodies in your blood sample. This chemical reaction makes the blood sample clot more slowly than the blood in your body. If your provider thinks that an autoimmune disease is causing a clotting problem, you will usually have other tests to make a diagnosis. If your blood clotted faster than normal on a PTT test, it may be a sign of: The early stage of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This rare but serious condition may develop if you have an infection or damage to organs or tissues that affects blood clotting. In the early stage, you have too much blood clotting. Later on, DIC starts to use up clotting factors in your blood, which leads to bleeding problems. Cancer of the ovaries, colon, or pancreas that is advanced, which means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and is unlikely to be controlled with treatment. Talk with your provider to learn what your test results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a PTT test? If your provider thinks you may have a clotting disorder linked to lupus, you may have a test called an LA-PTT. This is a type of PTT test that is designed to look for a protein that's linked to increased clotting and having many miscarriages.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests are a fast, highly accurate way to diagnose certain infectious diseases and genetic changes. The tests work by finding the DNA or RNA of a pathogen (disease-causing organism) or abnormal cells in a sample. DNA is the genetic material that contains instructions and information for all living things. RNA is another type of genetic material. It contains information that has been copied from DNA and is involved in making proteins. Most viruses and other pathogens contain DNA or RNA. Unlike many other tests, PCR tests can find evidence of disease in the earliest stages of infection. Other tests may miss early signs of disease because there aren't enough viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens in the sample, or your body hasn't had enough time to develop an antibody response. Antibodies are proteins made by your immune system to attack foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. PCR tests can detect disease when there is only a very small amount of pathogens in your body. During a PCR test, a small amount of genetic material in a sample is copied multiple times. The copying process is known as amplification. If there are pathogens in the sample, amplification will make them much easier to see. Other names: polymerase chain reaction, rtPCR, reverse transcription PCR, qPCR, quantitative PCR, real-time PCR1How are they used? PCR tests are used to: Diagnose certain infectious diseases Identify a genetic change that can cause disease Find small amounts of cancer cells that might be missed in other types of tests11How do they work? PCR tests work by: Taking a sample of blood, saliva, mucus, or tissue The sample will contain your own DNA and possibly the DNA of a pathogen or cancer cell. The sample is put in a special machine. An enzyme called polymerase is added to the sample. This causes the sample to produce copies. The copying process is repeated multiple times. After about an hour, billions of copies are made. If a virus or pathogen is present, it will be indicated on the machine. Certain viruses, including COVID-19, are made up of RNA rather than DNA. For these viruses, the RNA must be changed into DNA before copying. This process is called reverse transcription PCR (rtPCR). PCR and rtPCR check for the presence of a pathogen. Another type of PCR known as quantitative PCR (qPCR) measures the amount of pathogens in the sample. qPCR can be done at the same time as PCR or rtPCR.1What happens during a PCR test? There are different ways to get a sample for a PCR test. Common methods include blood tests and nasal swabs. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. A nasal swab may be taken from the front part of your nostrils (anterior nares). It also may be taken from the back of your nostrils, in a procedure known as a nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab, or from the nasopharynx, the uppermost part of your nose and throat. In some cases, a health care provider will ask you to do an anterior nares test or an NMT swab yourself. During an anterior nares test, you will start by tilting your head back. Then you or the provider will: Gently insert a swab inside your nostril Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10 to 15 seconds Remove the swab and insert it into your second nostril Swab the second nostril using the same technique Remove the swab During an NMT swab, you will start by tilting your head back. Then you or your provider will: Gently insert a swab onto the bottom of the nostril, pushing it until you feel it stopping Rotate the swab for 15 seconds Remove the swab and insert it into your second nostril Swab the second nostril using the same technique Remove the swab During a nasopharyngeal swab: You will tip your head back. Your health care provider will insert a swab into your nostril until it reaches your nasopharynx (the upper part of your throat). Your provider will rotate the swab and remove it.1Do I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You don't need any special preparations for a PCR test.1Are there are any risks to a PCR test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. A nasal swab may tickle your throat or cause you to cough. A nasopharyngeal swab may be uncomfortable and cause coughing or gagging. All these effects are temporary.11Is there anything else I need to know about PCR tests? PCR tests are an accurate and reliable method for identifying many infectious diseases. And because they are often able to make diagnoses before symptoms of infection occur, PCR tests play a crucial role in preventing the spread of diseases.1References Allina Health [Internet].

A PD-L1 test uses a sample of cancerous tumor tissue to measure how much of a protein called PD-L1 is found on the cancer cells. If you have certain types of cancer, PD-L1 testing can check whether you may benefit from a type of cancer treatment called immunotherapy. Immunotherapy helps your own immune system fight cancer. Normally, PD-L1 is found on certain healthy cells. It acts as a kind of "brake" to stop cells in your immune system, called T cells, from attacking healthy cells in your body. If cancer cells have high amounts of PD-L1, they can turn your T cells off so they can't attack the cancer cells. If high amounts of PD-L1 are found on cancer cells, immunotherapy medicines called "immune checkpoint inhibitors" may be used. These medicines prevent the PD-L1 protein from putting the brakes on T cells. This frees your T cells to fight cancer. Immunotherapy can help stop or slow the growth of many types of cancers that have PD-L1. Immunotherapy has fewer side effects than cancer chemotherapy. But it can cause serious side effects in some people, and not everyone benefits from it. There are many types of PD-L1 tests. The test your health care provider orders will depend on: The type of cancer you have The specific immunotherapy medicine that your provider is considering for you Other names: programmed death-ligand 1, PDLI, PDL-1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC)1What is it used for? PD-L1 testing is used to look for the PD-L1 protein on cancer cells in a sample of tumor tissue. The test also measures the amount of PD-L1 in the tissue. This information helps find out if immunotherapy medicines could help control your cancer.1Why do I need a PD-L1 test? If you've been diagnosed with cancer, you may need PD-L1 testing to find out if immunotherapy could help you. Many types of cancer have immunotherapy treatments related to PD-L1. These cancers include: Non-small cell lung cancer Melanoma Hodgkin lymphoma Bladder cancer Kidney cancer Breast cancer Head and neck cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) Cancer of the esophagus (squamous cell carcinoma) Stomach cancer (adenocarcinoma) Cervical cancer1What happens during a PD-L1 test? PD-L1 tests are done on a tissue sample from a tumor. If you're having surgery to remove a tumor, a sample will be taken for testing. If you aren't having the tumor removed, you may have a biopsy, which is a procedure to remove a small amount of tissue for testing. If you already had a biopsy to diagnose your cancer, the same tissue sample may be used to test for PD-L1. There are many ways to do a biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on the type of cancer you have and where the tumor is located. In general, a biopsy may be done using: A hollow needle inserted through your skin. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, may be used to guide the needle:

A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of cells and/or fluid.
A core needle biopsy uses a larger needle to remove a sample. 

 A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of cells and/or fluid. A core needle biopsy uses a larger needle to remove a sample.  Surgery. Surgery may be done to remove a sample of tissue (an incisional biopsy). In certain cases, the entire tumor will be removed (an excisional biopsy). A scope. Scopes are tools for looking inside your body. They may be inserted through an opening in your body or through a small incision (cut). Special tools may be used with a scope to remove a tissue sample. Examples of scope procedures include bronchoscopy, laparoscopy, colposcopy, and cystoscopy (to examine the inside of the bladder).1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Preparations for your test depend on how your tissue sample will be taken. Ask your provider how to prepare for your test.1Are there any risks to the test?  Risks depend on how your tissue sample is taken. In general, if you are having a biopsy, you may have a little bruising or bleeding where the tissue was removed. Ask your provider to explain any risks from the test you're having.1What do the results mean? Your test results will show whether you have enough PD-L1 protein in your tumor for you to benefit from a specific immunotherapy medicine. Some immunotherapy medicines will not be helpful if a small percentage of your cancer cells have PD-L1. If your test results show that: Your tumor cells have enough PD-L1 for you to use immunotherapy medicine, you may be able to start that medicine. This may be called a "positive" test result. Your tumor cells don't have enough PD-L1, then the immunotherapy is not likely to help you. This may be called a "negative" test result. Your provider will consider another type of cancer treatment. Your provider may also use other tests to help decide on the best treatment for you. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a PD-L1 test? Immunotherapy is a quickly changing area of medicine. For some immunotherapy medicines, PD-L1 testing is required to see if you are a good match for that treatment. For other medicines, testing is only recommended. But new research may change how tests are used to choose treatments. So, check with your provider to find out how PD-L1 testing may affect your treatment plan.1References American Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: American Cancer Society Inc.; c2022.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/center1024 PET Scan : 1What is a PET scan? A PET (positron emission tomography) scan is an imaging test that looks at how well your tissues and organs are working. It also checks for signs of cancer. The scan uses a small amount of a radioactive substance called a tracer. The tracer settles in areas of your body that have high levels of chemical activity. This activity can be a sign of cancer or other diseases. The tracer can also help measure blood flow, oxygen use, and changes in the metabolism of a particular tissue or organ. Metabolism is a chemical process that your body uses to change food into energy. Chemical changes in the body can show up before symptoms of disease appear. So a PET scan can find signs of disease at an early stage, often before problems can be seen on other imaging tests. Other names: positron emission tomography1What is it used for? A PET scan is most often used to: Diagnose or monitor certain cancers, including breast, thyroid, and lung cancers Find out how well your heart muscle is working Check blood flow to the heart Check for signs of certain brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and types of dementia. Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a term used to describe a decline in mental function that is severe enough to affect daily living. A PET scan is often done along with a CT scan, a type of x-ray that takes a series of pictures as it rotates around you.1Why do I need a PET scan? You may need a PET scan to find out if you have cancer. If you've already been diagnosed with cancer, you may need this test to see if your cancer treatment is working. A PET scan also helps diagnose and monitor heart and brain diseases. So you may need this test if you: Have a family history of heart disease Are being treated for heart disease. This test can show if the treatment is working. Have symptoms of a brain disease, such as tremors, memory problems, and/or seizures1What happens during a PET scan? Before the scan, you will change into a hospital gown. You may be asked to empty your bladder. During the scan: A health care provider will inject the radioactive tracer into your vein through an intravenous (IV) line. The tracer sends out a form of energy called gamma rays. The rays are picked up by the scanner to create images of the inside of your body. You will need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed by your body. This takes 45 to 60 minutes. You will then lie on a narrow, padded table, which will slide into a large, tunnel-shaped scanner. The scanner will move slowly across your body to capture images. You will need to be very still as this happens. The scanner will send images to a computer monitor for the provider to review. Your provider will then remove the IV line.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may be asked to not eat or drink for four to six hours before the test. If you have diabetes and use insulin, you may need to change the timing of your regular dose. Your provider will give you specific instructions about adjusting your insulin. Also, tell your provider if you have claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces). Your provider may decide to give you a medicine before the test to help you relax.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little exposure to radiation in a PET scan. Only a small amount of radioactive substance is used, and all of the radiation leaves the body within 2 to 10 hours. While radiation exposure in a PET scan is safe for most adults, it can be harmful to an unborn baby. So be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Also, tell your provider if you are breastfeeding, because the tracer may contaminate your breast milk. Allergic reactions to the tracer are rare and usually mild.1What do the results mean? Depending on which part of the body was being scanned, your results may show: Cancer. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on a PET scan. Heart disease. The scan can show decreased blood flow to the heart. A brain disorder. The scan may show changes in certain brain chemicals that can indicate disease. If you also had a CT scan, your provider will review the results of the two scans to help make a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a PET scan? Your PET scan results will be looked at by a radiologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating medical conditions using imaging technologies. He or she will share the results with your health care provider.1References ACR: American College of Radiology [Internet].

Pharmacogenetics (also called pharmacogenomics) is the study of how your genes affect the way your body responds to certain medicines. Your genes are passed down from your parents. They carry information (called DNA) that determines many things about you, such as your height and eye color. Some genes also affect how your body uses and breaks down medicines. Differences in these genes can be the reason why some people may benefit from a certain medicine while others may not benefit at all. Genes can also be the reason why some people have serious side effects from a medicine and others have none. Pharmacogenetic testing provides information about your genes to help your health care provider choose the medicine and dosage that are the "best fit" for you. The tests use a sample of your saliva (spit), blood, or cells swabbed from your cheek. Pharmacogenetic testing is a type of precision medicine. Precision medicine uses information about your genes, environment, and lifestyle to find out which approaches to disease treatment and prevention will work best for you. Other names: pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenomic testing1What is it used for? Pharmacogenetic testing may be used to: Find out whether a certain medicine could be effective for you Find out how much of the medicine you need Predict whether you will have a serious side effect from a medicine1Why do I need pharmacogenetic testing? Your provider may order these tests before you start a certain medicine. You may also need a pharmacogenetic test if you are taking a medicine that's not working and/or causing serious side effects. Pharmacogenetic tests are not available for all medicines. Examples of common medicines that have pharmacogenetic tests include: Abacavir, an HIV treatment Carbamazepine, an epilepsy treatment Tamoxifen, a breast cancer treatment Warfarin and clopidogrel, blood thinners1What happens during a pharmacogenetic test? Testing is usually done on blood, saliva, or a sample of cells swabbed from the inside of your cheek. For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a saliva test, you will be instructed how to provide your sample. Usually, you will either spit into a small tube or your saliva will be collected with a special swab or pad. For a cheek swab, a health care professional will gently rub the inside of your cheek with a special swab. At-home test kits are available for certain pharmacogenetic tests. With a home test, you collect a saliva sample to send to a lab for testing. In general, these tests should not be used for making treatment decisions because they may not be accurate. Talk with your provider if you're considering an at-home test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for a blood test. If you are getting a saliva test, you should not eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum for 30 minutes before the test. If you have a cheek swab, you may be asked to rinse your mouth first.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a saliva test or a cheek swab.1What do the results mean? Your test results will describe any changes, called variants, in the gene that was tested. Changes in these genes can show how certain medicines are likely to affect you. But these gene changes do not tell you anything about your health condition. Your provider will use the results of your pharmacogenetic test along with other information about your condition to recommend treatment or to make changes in your treatment. This includes suggesting which type of medicine is likely to work best in your body and how much you should take to get the most benefit. Your test results may also predict whether you're likely to have side effects. If your test results show that a certain medicine isn't right for you, your provider will consider other treatments that may help you. Talk with your provider to find out how your test results may change your treatment options. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about pharmacogenetic testing? Pharmacogenetic testing is not the same thing as genetic testing.  Genetic tests that are done for health reasons can help diagnose diseases. They may also provide information about your risk for certain diseases. Pharmacogenetic testing cannot diagnose any conditions or tell you about your risk for developing them.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

A PKU screening test is a blood test given to newborns one to three days after birth. PKU stands for phenylketonuria. It is a rare disorder that prevents the body from breaking down part of a protein called phenylalanine (Phe). Phe is in all foods that contain protein, such as milk, meats, and nuts. It's also in an artificial sweetener called aspartame. If you have PKU and eat foods with Phe, the Phe will build up in your blood. If the level gets too high, it can permanently damage your nervous system and brain. The damage can cause many types of health problems, including seizures, psychiatric problems, and learning and developmental disabilities. A PKU screening test diagnoses PKU by measuring the amount of Phe in a blood sample. PKU is a genetic disorder. That means it's caused by changes (also called variants or mutations) in a gene. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. The gene involved in PKU helps make a substance that breaks down Phe in food. PKU can vary from mild to severe, depending on whether the changed gene still works somewhat or has stopped working completely. PKU is rare. For a child to inherit PKU, both parents must pass down a changed gene. But all newborns in the United States are required to get a PKU test. That's because: The test is easy and has almost no health risks. And doing the test can save a baby from lifelong brain damage and/or other serious health problems. If PKU is found early, a special diet that's low in protein and Phe can prevent health problems Other names: PKU newborn screening, PKU test1What is it used for? A PKU test is used to see if a newborn has high blood levels of Phe in their blood. This may mean the baby has PKU. More tests may be needed to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.1Why does my baby need a PKU screening test? Newborns in the United States are required to get a PKU test. A PKU test is usually part of a series of tests called a newborn screening. Some older infants and children may need testing if they were born in another country. They may also be tested if they have any symptoms of PKU, which include: Delayed development Intellectual difficulties A musty odor in the breath, skin, and/or urine (pee) Unusually small head (microcephaly)1What happens during a PKU screening test? A health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol. Then the provider will stick the baby's heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood. The heel will then be bandaged. To get accurate test results, the baby needs to have some protein from breast milk or formula before the blood sample is taken. That's why the test is usually done a day or two after birth. If your baby wasn't born in the hospital or if you left the hospital early, be sure to talk with your child's provider to schedule a PKU test as soon as possible.1Will I need to do anything to prepare my baby for the test? There are no special preparations needed for a PKU test.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to your baby from a needle stick blood test. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked. A small bruise may form on the heel, but it should go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If the results are normal, it means that the amount of Phe in your baby's blood was normal. So, your baby is unlikely to have PKU. But if the test was done sooner than 24 hours after birth, your baby may need to be tested again at 1 to 2 weeks of age. If both parents know they carry a gene for PKU and baby's test is normal, the baby should have genetic testing. This blood test will check the baby's genes for changes. The results will diagnose PKU or rule it out for certain. If your baby's results are not normal, it means high levels of Phe were found in your baby's blood. Your baby most likely has PKU. Your provider may order more tests to confirm or rule out PKU. These tests may include more blood tests and/or urine tests. Because PKU is an inherited condition, you and your baby may have genetic testing. Genetic testing shows the type of gene change that's causing the disease. This information helps your provider understand how serious PKU is and how to treat it. In general, PKU is treated with a special low-protein diet which must be followed throughout life. This usually means limiting or avoiding high-protein foods, such as meats, fish, eggs, and beans.  People with PKU often take special food supplements for proper nutrition. In certain cases, PKU may also be treated with medicines. A nutrition specialist can help you plan a healthy diet to manage PKU. If your baby is diagnosed with PKU, you can safely give the baby formula that doesn't contain Phe. Breastmilk does contain Phe, so if you would like to breastfeed, talk with your baby's provider to find out if your baby can safely have any amount of breastmilk. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a PKU screening test? If you're pregnant, your baby could have PKU even if you and the baby's other parent don't have it.  That's because you have two copies of all your genes, one from each parent. To have PKU, you must have changes in both copies of the gene that causes PKU. If you and your baby's other parent each have one changed gene for PKU, your baby could inherit two changed genes and be born with the disease. A prenatal screening test can show whether your baby may have PKU. The test uses either a sample of: Amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the uterus.  A small amount of fluid is removed with a needle inserted into the belly during a procedure called amniocentesis. Tissue from part of the placenta, the organ that grows in the uterus to provide nutrients and oxygen to the unborn baby.  This sample is taken using a needle inserted into the belly or a tube inserted through the vagina in a procedure called chorionic villus sampling. Your provider or a genetic counselor can help you decide if prenatal testing for PKU is right for you.1References American Pregnancy Association [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw41965 Phosphate in Blood : 1What is a phosphate in blood test? A phosphate in blood test measures the amount of phosphate in your blood. Phosphate is an electrically charged particle that contains the mineral phosphorus. Phosphorus works together with the mineral calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Normally, the kidneys filter and remove excess phosphate from the blood. If phosphate levels in your blood are too high or too low, it can be a sign of kidney disease or other serious disorder. Other names: phosphorus test, P, PO4, phosphorus-serum1What is it used for? A phosphate in blood test may be used to: Diagnose and monitor kidney disease and bone disorders Diagnose parathyroid disorders. Parathyroid glands are small glands located in the neck. They make hormones that control the amount of calcium in the blood. If the gland makes too much or too little of these hormones, it can cause serious health problems. A phosphate in blood test is sometimes ordered along with tests of calcium and other minerals.1Why do I need a phosphate in blood test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of kidney disease or a parathyroid disorder. These include: Fatigue Muscle cramps Bone pain But many people with these disorders don't have symptoms. So your provider may order a phosphate test if he or she thinks you may have kidney disease based on your health history and the results of calcium tests. Calcium and phosphate work together, so problems with calcium levels can mean problems with phosphate levels as well. Calcium testing is often part of a routine checkup.1What happens during a phosphate in blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Certain medicines and supplements can affect phosphate levels. Tell your health care provider about any prescription and over-the-counter medicines you are taking. Your provider will let you know if you need to stop taking them for a few days before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The terms phosphate and phosphorus can mean the same thing in test results. So your results may show phosphorus levels rather than phosphate levels. If your test shows you have high phosphate/phosphorus levels, it may mean you have: Kidney disease Hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid gland doesn't make enough parathyroid hormone Too much vitamin D in your body Too much phosphate in your diet Diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication of diabetes If your test shows you have low phosphate/phosphorus levels, it may mean you have: Hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid gland produces too much parathyroid hormone Malnutrition Alcoholism Osteomalacia, condition that causes bones to become soft and deformed. It's caused by a vitamin D deficiency. When this condition happens in children, it's known as rickets. If your phosphate/phosphorus levels are not normal, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. Other factors, such as your diet, can affect your results. Also, children often have higher phosphate levels because their bones are still growing. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a phosphate in blood test? Your provider may order a phosphate in urine test instead of, or in addition to, a phosphate in blood test.1References Lab Tests Online [Internet].

A phosphate in urine test measures the amount of phosphate in a urine (pee) sample that you collect over a 24-hour period. Phosphate is an electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals. They help control the amount of fluid and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body. Phosphate is made of the mineral phosphorous combined with oxygen. Phosphate works with the mineral calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Most of your phosphate is stored in your bones. But phosphate is in every cell of your body and it affects almost everything your cells do, including how your nerves work and how your body uses energy. Most people get more phosphate than they need from food. Your kidneys control the amount of phosphate in your blood by removing most of the extra phosphate through your urine. Your parathyroid glands in your neck make hormones which affect how much phosphate your kidneys remove. If you have a problem with your kidneys or your parathyroid glands, the phosphate levels in your urine may be too high or too low. This can be a sign of a serious health problem. Other names: phosphorous test, P, PO4, inorganic phosphate, PO4 urine concentration1What is it used for? A phosphate in urine test may be used to help: Diagnose kidney problems Diagnose disorders of the parathyroid glands Find out if too much phosphate in urine is causing kidney stones, small, pebble-like material that form in the kidneys1Why do I need a phosphate in urine test? You may need a phosphate in urine test if you have: Symptoms of a kidney problem Had a kidney stone Problems with your electrolyte balance, which affects your acid/base (pH) level Had abnormal results on a calcium test Calcium and phosphate work together, so problems with calcium levels can mean problems with phosphate levels as well. Calcium testing in blood and/or urine is often part of a routine checkup.1What happens during a phosphate in urine test? You'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your sample. Your health care provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a phosphate in urine test. Be sure to carefully follow all the instructions for providing a 24-hour urine sample.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a phosphate in urine test.1What do the results mean? The terms phosphate and phosphorous are both used to mean the same thing in test results. So, your results may say "phosphorous levels" or "phosphate levels." Your results may include guidelines for normal, low, and high levels, but your provider will consider your health, age, and other factors when deciding what is normal for you. High phosphate/phosphorous levels in your urine may mean you have: Kidney disease Hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid gland produces too much parathyroid hormone. Too much vitamin D in your body, usually from taking too many supplements Low phosphate/phosphorous levels in your urine may mean you have: Kidney disease Liver disease Hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid gland produces too little parathyroid hormone Your provider will likely order other tests to help make a diagnosis. If your phosphate/phosphorous levels are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Eating a meal high in phosphorous or using laxatives with sodium phosphate can affect your results. Also, children often have higher phosphate levels because their bones are still growing. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a phosphate in urine test? Phosphate is often tested in blood. Your provider may order both a blood and urine test to see how much phosphate your kidneys are removing.1References Goyal R, Jialal I. Hyperphosphatemia. [Updated 2021 Sep 28; cited 2022 May 26].

Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells that are essential for blood clotting. Clotting is the process that helps you stop bleeding after an injury. There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests. A platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood. A lower than normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding. A higher than normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow. Platelet function tests check your platelets' ability to form clots. Platelet function tests include: Closure time. This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders. Viscoelastometry. This test measures the strength of a blood clot as it forms. A blood clot has to be strong to stop bleeding. Platelet aggregometry. This is a group of tests that are used to measure how well platelets clump together (aggregate). Lumiaggregometry. This test measures the amount of light produced when certain substances are added to a blood sample. It can help show if there are defects in the platelets. Flow cytometry. This is a test that uses lasers to look for proteins on the surface of platelets. It can help diagnose inherited platelet disorders. This is a specialized test. It is only available at certain hospitals and laboratories. Bleeding time. This test measures the amount of time for bleeding to stop after small cuts are made in the forearm. It was once commonly used to screen for a variety of platelet disorders. Now, other platelet function tests are used more often. The newer tests provide more reliable results. Other names: platelet count, thrombocyte count, platelet function tests, platelet function assay, platelet aggregation studies1What are they used for? A platelet count is most often used to monitor or diagnose conditions that cause too much bleeding or too much clotting. A platelet count may be included in a complete blood count, a test that is often done as part of a regular checkup. Platelet function tests may be used to: Help diagnose certain platelet diseases Check platelet function during complex surgical procedures, such as cardiac bypass and trauma surgery. These types of procedures have an increased risk of bleeding. Check patients before surgery, if they have a personal or family history of bleeding disorders Monitor people who are taking blood thinners. These medicines may be given to reduce clotting in people at risk for heart attack or stroke.1Why do I need a platelet test? You may need platelet count and/or platelet function testing if you have symptoms of having too few or too many platelets. Symptoms of too few platelets include: Prolonged bleeding after a minor cut or injury Nosebleeds Unexplained bruising Pinpoint sized red spots on the skin, known as petechiae Purplish spots on the skin, known as purpura. These may be caused by bleeding under the skin. Heavy and/or prolonged menstrual periods Symptoms of too many platelets include: Numbness of hands and feet Headache Dizziness Weakness You may also need platelet function testing if you are: Undergoing a complex surgery Taking medicines to reduce clotting1What happens during a platelet test? Most platelet tests are done on a blood sample. During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a platelet count test If you are getting a platelet function test, you may need to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show a lower than normal platelet count (thrombocytopenia), it may indicate: A cancer that affects the blood, such as leukemia or lymphoma A viral infection, such as mononucleosis, hepatitis, or measles An autoimmune disease. This is a disorder that causes the body to attack its own healthy tissues, which can include platelets. Infection or damage to the bone marrow Cirrhosis Vitamin B12 deficiency Gestational thrombocytopenia, a common, but mild, low-platelet condition affecting pregnant women. It is not known to cause any harm to a mother or her unborn baby. It usually gets better on its own during pregnancy or after birth. If your results show a higher than normal platelet count (thrombocytosis), it may indicate: Certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer or breast cancer Anemia Inflammatory bowel disease Rheumatoid arthritis A viral or bacterial infection If your platelet function test results were not normal, it may mean you have an inherited or acquired platelet disorder.  Inherited disorders are passed down from your family. The conditions are present at birth, but you may not have symptoms until you are older. Acquired disorders are not present at birth. They may be caused by other diseases, medicines, or exposure in the environment. Sometimes the cause is unknown. Inherited platelet disorders include: Von Willebrand disease, a genetic disorder that reduces the production of platelets or causes the platelets to work less effectively. It can cause excess bleeding. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a disorder that affects platelets' ability to clump together Bernard-Soulier syndrome, another disorder that affects platelets' ability to clump together Storage pool disease, a condition that affects platelets' ability to release substances that help platelets clump together Acquired platelet disorders may be due to chronic diseases such as: Kidney failure Certain types of leukemia Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a disease of the bone marrow1Is there anything else I need to know about platelet function tests? Platelet tests are sometimes done along with one or more of the following blood tests: MPV blood test, which measures the size of your platelets Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test, which measures the time it takes for blood to clot Prothrombin time and INR test, which checks the body's ability to form blood clots1References Cleveland Clinic [Internet].

The pleura is a two-layer membrane that covers the lungs and lines the chest cavity. Pleural fluid keeps the pleura moist and reduces friction between the membranes when you breathe. The area that contains pleural fluid is known as the pleural space. Normally, there is a small amount of pleural fluid in the pleural space.  Sometimes too much fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is known as pleural effusion. Pleural effusion prevents the lungs from fully inflating, making it hard to breathe. A pleural fluid analysis is a group of tests that look for the cause of pleural effusion. Other names: pleural fluid aspiration1What is it used for? A pleural fluid analysis is used to find the cause of pleural effusion. There are two main types of pleural effusion: Transudate, which happens when there is an imbalance of pressure in certain blood vessels. This causes extra fluid to leak into the pleural space. Transudate pleural effusion is most often caused by heart failure or cirrhosis. Exudate, which happens when there is an injury or inflammation of the pleura. This can make excess fluid leak out of certain blood vessels. Exudate pleural effusion has many causes. These include infections such as pneumonia, cancer, kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases. It commonly affects only one side of the chest. To help figure out which type of pleural effusion you have, your health care provider may use a method known as Light's criteria. Light's criteria is a calculation that compares some of the findings of your pleural fluid analysis with the results of one or more protein blood tests. It's important to find out which type of pleural effusion you have, so you can get the right treatment.1Why do I need a pleural fluid analysis? You may need this test if you have symptoms of pleural effusion. These include: Chest pain Dry, nonproductive cough (a cough that doesn't bring up mucus) Trouble breathing Fatigue Some people with pleural effusion don't have symptoms right away. But your provider may order this test if you've had a chest x-ray for another reason, and it shows signs of pleural effusion.1What happens during a pleural fluid analysis? Your health care provider will need to remove some pleural fluid from your pleural space. This is done through a procedure called thoracentesis. The procedure may be done in a doctor's office or hospital. During the procedure: You will need to take off most of your clothes and then put on a paper or cloth gown to cover yourself. You will sit on a hospital bed or chair, with your arms resting on a padded table. This puts your body in the right position for the procedure. Your provider will clean an area on your back with an antiseptic solution. Your provider will inject a numbing medicine into your skin, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Once the area is completely numb, your provider will insert a needle in your back between the ribs. The needle will go into the pleural space. Your provider may use ultrasound imaging to help find the best spot to insert the needle. You may feel some pressure as the needle goes in. Your provider will withdraw fluid into the needle. You may be asked to hold your breath or breathe out deeply at certain times during the procedure. When enough fluid has been removed, the needle will be taken out and the procedure area will be bandaged. Blood tests for certain proteins are used to calculate Light's criteria. So you may also get a blood test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a thoracentesis or a blood test. But your provider may order a chest x-ray before the procedure.1Are there any risks to the test? Thoracentesis is a generally safe procedure. Risks are usually minor and may include pain and bleeding at the procedure site. Serious complications are uncommon, but may include a collapsed lung or pulmonary edema, a condition in which too much pleural fluid is removed. Your provider may order a chest x-ray after the procedure to check for complications.1What do the results mean? Your results can show whether you have a transudate or exudate type of pleural effusion. Transudate pleural effusions are most often caused by heart failure or cirrhosis. Exudate effusions may be caused by a number of different diseases and conditions. Once the type of pleural effusion has been determined, your provider will likely order more tests to make a specific diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a pleural fluid analysis? Your pleural fluid results may be compared with other tests, including tests for glucose and for albumin, a protein made by the liver. The comparisons may be used as part of Light's criteria to help figure out what kind of pleural effusion you have.1References Cleveland Clinic [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c2019.

Porphyrin tests measure the level of porphyrins in your blood, urine (pee), or stool (poop). Your body uses porphyrins to make heme. Heme is part of hemoglobin , which is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. It's normal to have a small amount of porphyrins in your blood and other body fluids. But too much porphyrin may mean you have a type of porphyria. Porphyrias are a group of diseases that happen if you lack one of the proteins necessary to change porphyrins into heme. If your body doesn't use porphyrins correctly, they can build up and cause illness. Porphyrias are very uncommon disorders that are usually inherited. That means these diseases tend to run in families because of a change in a gene that's passed down from parents to children. There are two main groups of porphyrias: Acute porphyrias happen suddenly and usually last days or weeks. They mainly affect the nervous system. Sometimes they affect the skin, too. Cutaneous porphyrias are long lasting and affect only the skin, causing blisters or pain when you are exposed to sunlight Each group of porphyrias includes different types of the disease. Other names: protoporphyrin; protoporphyrin, blood; protoporhyrin, stool; porphyrins, feces; uroporphyrin; porphyrins, urine; Mauzerall-Granick test; acid; ALA; porphobilinogen; PBG; free erythrocyte protoporphyrin; fractionated erythrocyte porphyrins; FEP1What are they used for? Porphyrin tests are used to diagnose or monitor all types of porphyria.1Why do I need a porphyrin test? You may need a porphyrin test if you have symptoms of porphyria. Each porphyria group has different symptoms: Symptoms of acute porphyria may be mild or severe. Without early treatment, they may get worse and even become life-threatening. Symptoms may include: Pain in the abdomen (belly), back, or arms and legs Constipation Nausea and vomiting Mental changes, such as anxiety, confusion, and seizures Problems urinating (peeing), leaking urine, or red or brown urine Problems with nerves that control movement, which may cause muscle weakness, paralysis, and breathing problems Skin blisters when skin is in sunlight (for certain types of acute porphyria) Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria happen when skin is exposed to sunlight. Symptoms of some types of cutaneous porphyria include: Blisters Fragile skin that is easily wounded and slow to heal Infections in blisters or wounds Changes in skin color or scarring Other types of cutaneous porphyria usually don't cause blisters. Instead, sunlight may cause these skin symptoms: Pain, burning, stinging, or tingling Redness Swelling If someone in your family has porphyria, you may need a porphyrin test to see if you have inherited the condition. But the most common type of porphyria isn't inherited. It usually develops after age 30 and may be caused by conditions, such as: Hemochromatosis Alcohol use disorder Smoking Viral infections, such as hepatitis C and HIV Taking estrogen in medicines, such as birth control pills and hormonal replacement therapy.1What happens during porphyrin testing? Porphyrins can be tested in blood, urine, or stool. The most common types of porphyrin tests are listed below. Blood Test

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. 24-Hour Urine Sample

You will collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. For this test, your health care provider or laboratory will give you a container and specific instructions on how to collect your samples at home. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully. This 24-hour urine sample test is used because the amounts of substances in urine, including porphyrin, can vary throughout the day. So collecting several samples in a day may give a more accurate picture of your urine content.

You will collect a sample of your stool and place it in a special container. Your  provider will give you instructions on how to prepare your sample and send it to a lab.

 You will collect a sample of your stool and place it in a special container. Your  provider will give you instructions on how to prepare your sample and send it to a lab.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for blood or urine tests. For a stool test, you may be instructed to not eat meat or take any aspirin-containing medicines for three days prior to your test.1Are there any risks to porphyrin tests? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to urine or stool tests.1What do the results mean? If high levels of porphyrin are found in your blood, urine, or stool, your provider will probably order more tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out what kind of porphyria you have. While there is no cure for porphyria, the condition can be managed. Certain lifestyle changes and/or medicines can help prevent the symptoms and complications of the disease. Specific treatment depends on the type of porphyria you have. If you have questions about your results or about porphyria, talk to your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about porphyrin tests? While most types of porphyria are inherited, other types of porphyria can also be acquired. Acquired porphyria can be caused by a variety of factors, including overexposure to lead, HIV, hepatitis C, excess iron intake, and/or heavy alcohol use.1References American Porphyria Foundation [Internet].

Postpartum means "after birth." A postpartum depression screening is a set of questions you answer. Your health care provider uses the screening to help find out if you have developed depression related to having a baby. Postpartum depression is different than the "baby blues." With the baby blues, you may feel sad, weepy, or anxious starting about three days after childbirth. These feelings tend to come and go, and usually get better on their own within a week or two. But postpartum depression is a serious mood disorder that may last for months and may not get better without treatment. Symptoms of postpartum depression usually start between one to three weeks after birth. But they can begin anytime during the first year after your baby is born. The symptoms are more intense than the baby blues and may include extreme hopelessness and a lack of interest in the baby. Postpartum depression can affect your health and your baby's development, too. Depression after birth is common, but it's not a regular part of having a baby. It may have more than one cause. Sudden changes in hormone levels that happen after a pregnancy may be involved. Lack of sleep, stress from new routines, and other changes may also play a role in triggering postpartum depression. A postpartum depression screening helps diagnose the condition so it can be treated early. And early treatment can help prevent long-lasting depression.  Most people get better with medicine and/or talk therapy. In the most serious cases, treatment may include brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called "shock therapy." Other names: postpartum depression assessment, EPDS test1What is it used for? A postpartum depression screening is used to help find out if you have depression after giving birth. The screening is often used as part of a routine checkup a few weeks after your baby is born. The test may be repeated to check for depression symptoms that may develop later.1Why do I need postpartum depression screening? Anyone who has had a baby can develop postpartum depression. So, medical experts recommend screening for depression as part of routine care after childbirth.  But if you have symptoms of postpartum depression, don't wait for your routine checkup. Contact your provider to have a screening as soon as possible. Symptoms of postpartum depression include: Feeling sad or empty most of the time Eating too much or too little Sleeping too much or too little Crying a lot Feeling angry Pulling away from family and friends Worrying or feeling anxious Not having any interest in your baby Constant doubts about your ability to care for your baby Thinking about hurting yourself or your baby If you have thoughts about suicide, or hurting yourself or your baby get help right away: Call 911 or go to your local emergency room Contact a crisis hotline.

You may have a postpartum depression screening as part of a routine checkup after giving birth. Your baby's provider may also screen you for postpartum depression at your baby's routine well-infant visits. During the screening you'll answer a set of questions. Your provider may ask the questions, or you may fill out a questionnaire form to discuss with your provider later. One of the most common questionnaires is called the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS includes 10 questions about your mood and thoughts. Your provider may also order a blood test to find out if a physical condition, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, may be causing your depression. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a postpartum depression screening? You usually don't need any special preparations for a postpartum depression screening.1Are there any risks to screening? There is no risk to having a physical exam or taking a questionnaire. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your screening shows you may have postpartum depression, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible. You may need treatment from a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. Along with medicine and talk therapy, there are things you can do at home that may help you feel better, such as: Asking for help caring for the baby and doing other household chores Spending time with other adults Taking time for yourself Resting when the baby rests Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a postpartum depression screening? You may have heard the terms "perinatal depression" and "peripartum depression." They both describe depression that happens either during pregnancy or just after birth.  Research shows that depression during pregnancy increases your risk of postpartum depression. To help prevent postpartum depression, some medical experts recommend depression screening during routine pregnancy checkups. A rare but more serious form of postpartum depression is called postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis may cause hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't real) and confusion. It is a medical emergency and it's important to get help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room.1References ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/5112 Potassium Blood Test : 1What is a Potassium Blood Test? A potassium blood test measures the amount of potassium in your blood. Potassium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control fluid levels and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body. They also help control muscle and nerve activity and perform other important functions. Your cells, nerves, heart, and muscles need potassium to work properly. Potassium levels that are too high or too low may be a sign of a medical problem. Other names: potassium serum, serum potassium, serum electrolytes, K1What is it used for? A potassium blood test measures how much potassium is in your blood. The test is often part of a group of routine blood tests called an electrolyte panel. It may be used to monitor or diagnose conditions related to abnormal potassium levels. These conditions include kidney disease, high blood pressure, and heart disease.1Why do I need a potassium blood test? Your health care provider may order a potassium blood test as part of your regular checkup or to monitor an existing condition, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenal gland disorders. You may also need this test if you take medicines that could affect your potassium levels or if you have symptoms of having too much or too little potassium. If your potassium levels are too high (hyperkalemia), your symptoms may include: Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Fatigue Muscle weakness Nausea Numbness or tingling If your potassium levels are too low (hypokalemia), your symptoms may include: Irregular heartbeat Muscle cramps Weak or twitching muscles Fatigue Nausea Constipation1What happens during a potassium blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a potassium blood test or an electrolyte panel. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Too much potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). It's often the result of two or more causes. High potassium levels may be a sign of: Kidney disease. Your kidneys remove extra potassium from your body. Too much potassium may mean your kidneys aren't working well. Addison disease, a disorder of the adrenal glands Injuries, burns, or surgery that can cause your cells to release extra potassium into your blood Type 1 diabetes that is not well controlled The side effects of certain medicines, such as diuretics ("water pills") or antibiotics A diet too high in potassium (not common). Bananas, apricots, green leafy vegetables, avocados and many other foods are good sources of potassium that are part of a healthy diet. But eating very large amounts of potassium-rich foods or taking potassium supplements can lead to health problems. Too little potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) may be a sign of: Use of prescription diuretics Fluid loss from diarrhea, vomiting, or heavy sweating Using too many laxatives Adrenal gland disorders, including Cushing's syndrome and aldosteronism Kidney disease Alcohol use disorder (AUD) A diet too low in potassium (not common) If your test results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain prescription and over-the-counter medicines and supplements may raise your potassium levels. And eating a lot of licorice may lower your levels. But only real licorice, which comes from licorice plants, has this effect. Most licorice products sold in the U.S. don't contain any real licorice. Check the package ingredient label to be sure. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.  Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a potassium blood test? Repeated clenching and relaxing of your fist just before or during your blood test may temporarily increase the potassium levels in your blood. This may lead to an incorrect result.1References FDA: US Food and Drug Administration [Internet].

A prealbumin blood test measures prealbumin levels in your blood. Prealbumin is a protein that's made in your liver. Prealbumin helps carry thyroid hormones and vitamin A through your bloodstream. It also helps control how your body uses energy. If your prealbumin levels are lower than normal, it may be a sign of malnutrition. Malnutrition is a condition where your body doesn't get enough of the nutrients that you need for good health, such as protein, vitamins, and minerals. Malnutrition can happen if you: Don't eat enough food Eat enough, but don't eat healthy, nutritious foods Have problems absorbing nutrients Have an increased need for nutrients because of infection, a serious injury, cancer, recovery after surgery, or other conditions Other names: thyroxine binding prealbumin, PA, transthyretin test, transthyretin, tryptophan-rich prealbumin1What is it used for? A prealbumin test may be used to help: Find out if you are getting enough nutrients, especially protein, in your diet Check for nutrition problems if you have a risk of malnutrition because you:

Are in the hospital with certain diseases
Have had surgery
Have a serious or chronic (long-lasting) illness
Get dialysis treatment for kidney disease and need to avoid eating many types of food
Are fed by parenteral nutrition ("artificial feeding"), which means that you get a nutritional liquid through an intravenous (IV) tube

Your provider may order a prealbumin test to help diagnose and monitor problems with your nutritional health. You may also need this test before surgery or if you have symptoms of malnutrition, such as: Weight loss Weakness  Dizziness Dry skin Dry, brittle hair and/or hair loss Feeling cold Aching joints Children with malnutrition may not grow and develop normally.1What happens during a prealbumin blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a prealbumin test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Prealbumin levels that are lower than normal may happen with: Malnutrition Inflammation Trauma, such as a burn injury Serious or long-term illness, such as cancer Liver disease Serious infection Hyperthyroidism Certain digestive diseases If you have low prealbumin levels and you are ill, injured, or recovering from surgery, it may be difficult to know exactly what is causing the low levels. Your provider may need to do other tests to find out more about your nutritional health. Prealbumin levels that are higher than normal may happen with several conditions, including: Hodgkin disease Kidney failure Alcohol use disorder Prealbumin testing is not used to diagnose or monitor these conditions. If you have high prealbumin levels, your provider may order other tests to diagnose your condition. If your prealbumin levels are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines and pregnancy can affect your prealbumin levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a prealbumin blood test? Some medical experts don't think a prealbumin test is the best way to diagnose or monitor malnutrition. That's because other medical conditions can cause low prealbumin levels. More research is needed to understand how prealbumin works in the body and what abnormal test results may mean.  But many providers still find prealbumin blood tests useful for monitoring nutrition, especially in people who are seriously ill or in the hospital.1References Eat Right [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/abo7852 Pregnancy Test : 1What is a pregnancy test? A pregnancy test can tell whether you're pregnant by checking a sample of your urine (pee) or blood for a specific hormone. The hormone is called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). High levels of hCG are a sign of pregnancy. hCG increases quickly in the first ten weeks after a fertilized egg attaches to the inside wall of the uterus. Urine tests for pregnancy are most accurate when you do the test a week or two after you've missed your menstrual period. If you take a urine test too close to the time you got pregnant, the test could say that you are not pregnant even when you really are. That's because your body may not yet have made enough hCG to show up on the test. You can have an hCG urine test at your health care provider's office or you can do the test yourself with an at-home test kit. These tests are basically the same, so many people use a home pregnancy test before calling their provider. If you follow the instructions carefully, home pregnancy tests are about 97-99% accurate. They can give you the results in minutes. Blood tests for pregnancy can be done at your provider's office or a lab. These tests can find very small amounts of hCG, so they can accurately show whether you're pregnant before you've missed your period. But hCG blood tests aren't commonly used to check for pregnancy. That's because urine tests are less expensive, very accurate, and provide quicker results than blood tests. hCG blood test results may take hours to more than a day. Other names: human chorionic gonadotropin test, HCG test, qualitative hCG blood test, quantitative hCG blood test, Beta-hCG urine test, total chorionic gonadotropin, hCG total OB1What is it used for? A pregnancy test is used to find out whether you're pregnant.1Why do I need a pregnancy test? You may need this test if you think you're pregnant. Symptoms of pregnancy vary from person to person. The most common sign of early pregnancy is a missed period. Other common signs of early pregnancy may include: Swollen, tender breasts Fatigue Frequent need to urinate (pee) Nausea and vomiting (also called morning sickness) Feeling bloated or swollen in your abdomen (belly) or body If you need to have medical treatment that could harm an unborn baby, you may also need a pregnancy test to make sure that you aren't pregnant.1What happens during a pregnancy test? Home pregnancy tests are quick and easy to use. You can buy a home pregnancy test kit without a prescription. The kits include test sticks or strips that react to hCG in your urine. The steps for doing a test depend on the brand, so it's very important to follow the instructions that come with your test. For most test kits, you'll either: Hold the test stick or strip in your urine stream Collect your urine in a cup and dip the test stick or strip into the cup After waiting a certain number of minutes, you'll check your results on the test stick or strip. The instructions will tell you what to look for. In general, to get the most accurate results with any home pregnancy test, you'll need to: Check the expiration date before you use the test. Test your first morning urine. Morning urine usually has more hCG than urine later in the day. Use a timer. If you guess the timing, your results may not be accurate. Blood tests are done at your provider's office or a lab. A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This process usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you're doing a urine test, don't drink large amounts of fluid before collecting your sample. That could dilute the hCG in your urine, and it may not show up on the test. Otherwise, you don't need any special preparations for a pregnancy test that uses urine or blood.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is no known risk to having a urine test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results means? Your results will show whether you're pregnant. A negative result means hCG wasn't found in your sample, so you may not be pregnant. But a negative result doesn't always mean you're not pregnant. If you did a home urine test too soon, your body may not have made enough hCG to show up the test. hCG levels increase every day during early pregnancy, so it's a good idea to repeat the test again in a week. If you get negative (not pregnant) results on two home tests, but you still think you're pregnant, call your provider. If you get a negative result on a test that your provider does, ask your provider if you need another test. A positive result means that hCG was found in your sample. That usually means that you're pregnant. It's important to see your provider as soon as possible to make sure you get the right care. If you did a home test, your provider may do another test to confirm your pregnancy. If you're taking medicine to help you get pregnant (fertility drugs), your test results may show that you're pregnant when you're not. Your provider can check to see whether you're really pregnant. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a pregnancy test? Most pregnancy tests simply measure whether or not you have hCG in your sample. But certain pregnancy tests also measure how much hCG you have. These tests are called quantitative hCG tests, and they're usually done on blood samples. The amount of hCG in your body can give your provider important information about your pregnancy and the health of your unborn baby. Quantitative hCG tests are sometimes used to help: Find out the age of the fetus if you're very early in your pregnancy Monitor your pregnancy if you have a high risk of miscarriage Check for certain problems, such as:

Ectopic pregnancy, which is a fertilized egg that tries to grow outside of the uterus. The egg cannot grow into a baby when it's in the wrong place. It must be removed to avoid damage to your organs. This can be a medical emergency.
Molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole), which is an abnormal growth of tissue in the uterus. It's caused by a fertilized egg with such severe genetic problems that it cannot become a baby. The growth can turn into cancer and must be removed.
Problems in the unborn baby, including Down syndrome, other chromosome problems, and certain birth defects (hCG testing is usually part of a group of prenatal screening tests called a "triple" or "quadruple" screen test.)

Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening is a blood test for pregnant women. During pregnancy, some of an unborn baby's DNA circulates in the mother's bloodstream. A cfDNA screening checks this DNA to find out if the baby is more likely to have Down syndrome or another disorder caused by a trisomy. A trisomy is a disorder of the chromosomes. Chromosomes are the parts of your cells that contain your genes. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color. People normally have 46 chromosomes, divided into 23 pairs, in each cell. If one of these pairs has an extra copy of a chromosome, it's called a trisomy. A trisomy causes changes in the way the body and brain develop. In Down syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is also known as trisomy 21. Down syndrome is the most common chromosome disorder in the United States. Other trisomy disorders include Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), where there is an extra copy of chromosome 18, and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), where there is an extra copy of chromosome 13. These disorders are rare but more serious than Down syndrome. Most babies with trisomy 18 or trisomy 13 die within the first year of life. A cfDNA screening has very little risk to you and your baby, but it can't tell you for sure whether your baby has a chromosome disorder. Your health care provider will need to order other tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. Other names: cell-free fetal DNA, cffDNA, non-invasive prenatal test, NIPT1What is used for? A cfDNA screening is most often used to show if your unborn baby has an increased risk for one of the following chromosome disorders: Down syndrome (trisomy 21) Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) The screening may also be used to: Determine a baby's gender (sex). This may be done if an ultrasound shows that a baby's genitals are not clearly male or female. This may be caused by a disorder of the sex chromosomes. Check Rh blood type. Rh is a protein found on red blood cells. If you have the protein, you are considered Rh positive. If you don't, you are Rh negative. If you are Rh negative and your unborn baby is Rh positive, your body's immune system may attack your baby's blood cells. If you find out you are Rh negative early in pregnancy, you can take medicines to protect your baby from dangerous complications. A cfDNA screening can be done as early as the 10th week of pregnancy.1Why do I need a prenatal cfDNA screening? Many health care providers recommend this screening to pregnant women who are at higher
risk of having a baby with a chromosome disorder. You may be at higher risk if: You are age 35 or older. A mother's age is the primary risk factor for having a baby with Down syndrome or other trisomy disorders. The risk increases as a woman gets older. You've had another baby with a chromosome disorder. Your fetal ultrasound didn't look normal. Other prenatal test results were not normal. Some health care providers recommend screening to all pregnant women. This is because the screening has almost no risk and has a high rate of accuracy compared with other prenatal screening tests. You and your health care provider should discuss if a cfDNA screening is right for you.1What happens during a prenatal cfDNA screening? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You may want to speak to a genetic counselor before you get tested. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing.  He or she can explain the possible results and what they might mean to you and your baby.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to your unborn baby and very little risk to you. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results were negative, it's unlikely that your baby has Down syndrome or another trisomy disorder. If your results were positive, it means there is an increased risk that your baby has one of these disorders. But it can't tell you for sure if your baby is affected. For a more confirmed diagnosis you'll need other tests, such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). These tests are usually very safe procedures, but they do have a slight risk of causing a miscarriage. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider and/or a genetic counselor. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a prenatal cfDNA screening? cfDNA screenings are not as accurate in women who are pregnant with more than one baby (twins, triplets, or more).1References ACOG: The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [Internet].

A prenatal panel is group of blood tests that are done early in pregnancy. The tests are used to check for diseases and infections that can affect the health of a pregnant woman and her unborn baby. The results can guide treatments, which may help prevent serious complications. A prenatal panel usually includes the following tests: Complete blood count (CBC). This test measures the different parts and features of your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A CBC can help diagnose a variety of health problems, such as anemia, clotting disorders, and infections. Blood type and Rh factor. This test finds out your blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and checks your Rh factor. Rh factor is a type of protein found on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood cells have this protein, you are Rh positive. If they don't, you are Rh negative. If you are Rh negative and your unborn baby is Rh positive, your body may begin to make antibodies against your baby's blood. Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection. This test shows if you have immunity to rubella. This means you have been vaccinated against rubella or have been infected with it in the past. If a woman gets infected with rubella during pregnancy, it can put her baby at risk for serious birth defects. Hepatitis B and C are viruses that infect the liver. The hepatitis virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby. Most pregnant women are tested for hepatitis B. Hepatitis C is not routinely tested, because is not common. But you may be tested if you have certain risk factors. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Most pregnant women are tested for chlamydia and syphilis early in pregnancy. You may also be tested for gonorrhea if you have certain risk factors. An STD can lead to miscarriage or infect your baby during delivery. An STD can be dangerous to a newborn. It may cause blindness, breathing problems, or other health issues. HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system and can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). If you have HIV, you may pass along the virus to your unborn baby. Many pregnant women are tested for HIV, and some states require testing. Other names: obstetric panel, OB panel1What is it used for? A prenatal panel is used to find health problems early in pregnancy. Many conditions can be treated during pregnancy to avoid complications. The test may also be used to guide treatments for a baby immediately after birth.1Why do I need a prenatal panel? Your health care provider will probably order these tests as part of a routine prenatal visit. The tests are done in the first trimester of pregnancy, often at the first prenatal visit.1What happens during a prenatal panel? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests? You don't need any special preparations for a prenatal panel.1Are there any risks to the tests? There is no risk to your unborn baby and very little risk to you. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results were not normal, you and/or your baby may get treatment to prevent serious health problems. Examples of some abnormal results and treatment include: Rh incompatibility. You will receive medicine that prevents your body from making antibodies against your baby's red blood cells. Infections (hepatitis, STDs, HIV). You will receive medicine to treat the infection. If you have a hepatitis B infection, your baby will get a vaccine within a few hours of birth. No immunity to rubella. You'll need to avoid anyone who has rubella while you are pregnant. After your baby is born, you should get vaccinated. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a prenatal panel? In addition to a prenatal panel, you may also get a urine test during your first trimester. Pregnancy urine tests are used to: Diagnose a urinary tract infection Check glucose levels. High levels of glucose in urine may be a sign of gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy. If your urine glucose was high, your provider may order a blood glucose test to confirm the diagnosis. Check protein levels. High levels of protein in urine can be a sign of a number of health problems, including kidney disease, infection, or stress. If your urine protein was high, your provider will probably order more tests.1References ACOG: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [Internet].

Available from: https://ufhealth.org/prenatal-care-your-first-trimester Procalcitonin Test : 1What is a Procalcitonin Test? A procalcitonin test measures the level of procalcitonin in your blood. Normally, you have very low levels of procalcitonin in your blood. But if you have a serious bacterial infection, the cells in many parts of your body will release procalcitonin into your bloodstream. A high level of procalcitonin in your blood may be a sign of a serious infection or sepsis. Sepsis (also called septicemia) is your immune system's extreme response to an infection, usually from bacteria. Sepsis happens when an infection you already have spreads into your bloodstream and triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. It causes inflammation and blood clots. Without quick treatment, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, or even death. Infections that lead to sepsis most often start in your lungs, urinary tract, skin, or digestive system. A procalcitonin test can help your health care provider diagnose if you have sepsis from a bacterial infection or if you have a high risk of developing sepsis. This may help you get the right treatment quickly before your condition worsens. Other names: PCT test1What is it used for? A procalcitonin test is mostly used if you are seriously ill and your provider thinks you may have a systemic infection (an infection that affects your entire body). The test helps find out whether bacteria or a virus is causing your infection. For example, a procalcitonin test can help tell the difference between bacterial and viral pneumonia. This matters because antibiotics may help bacterial infections, but not viral infections. The test may be used to help: Diagnose or rule out a bacterial infection and/or sepsis Find out how serious a sepsis infection may be Make treatment decisions Monitor how well treatment is working Diagnose kidney infections in children with urinary tract infections This test is usually used in the hospital for very sick people who are in the emergency room or have already been admitted to the hospital.1Why do I need a procalcitonin test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of sepsis or a serious bacterial infection that could become sepsis. Symptoms of sepsis include: Fever or chills Clammy or sweaty skin Confusion Extreme pain Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Low blood pressure Sepsis is a medical emergency. If your or your loved one has an infection that's not getting better or is getting worse, get medical help right away.1What happens during a procalcitonin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparation for a procalcitonin test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? High procalcitonin levels mean that you: Most likely have sepsis May have a high risk of developing severe sepsis and septic shock, a life-threatening condition when your organs don't get enough blood to work properly May have a serious systemic bacterial infection that increases your risk for sepsis The higher your procalcitonin levels, the higher your risk for sepsis and septic shock. Moderate to mildly high levels of procalcitonin may be sign of: The earlier stages of a systemic bacterial infection Kidney infection, in children only Conditions other than infections, such as tissue damage from trauma, serious burns, recent surgery, severe heart attack Slightly high levels of procalcitonin mean that you are unlikely to develop sepsis, but they may be a sign of: A local bacterial infection, such as a urinary tract infection An infection from another cause, such as a virus A systemic bacterial infection that is just beginning If you are being treated for a bacterial infection, decreasing or low procalcitonin levels mean that your treatment is working. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a procalcitonin test? A procalcitonin test won't show what type of bacteria is causing an infection. To make a full diagnosis, your provider will likely order other tests. But a procalcitonin test does give you important information about your risk for sepsis, so you can start treatment sooner, if needed, and avoid more serious illness.1References AACC [Internet] Washington D.C.; American Association for Clinical Chemistry; c2022.

A progesterone test measures the level of progesterone in a sample of your blood. Progesterone is a hormone that's made mainly by the ovaries, which are two glands in the female reproductive system that contain eggs. Each month, progesterone prepares your uterus for pregnancy. During a normal menstrual cycle, an ovary releases an egg and your progesterone levels begin to rise.  Progesterone makes the lining of your uterus grow thicker so that a fertilized egg can attach (implant) inside of the uterus and grow into a baby. If you don't become pregnant, your progesterone levels will fall. The lining of your uterus will become thinner again. When your uterus starts to get rid of the extra blood and tissue, your menstrual period will begin. If you become pregnant, progesterone levels will continue to rise to about 10 times higher than usual to support the pregnancy. High levels of progesterone prevent the uterus from contracting (squeezing) and causing pre-term labor. Much of the progesterone you need for a healthy pregnancy is made by the placenta. The placenta is the organ that grows in the uterus to provide nutrients and oxygen to the unborn baby. A progesterone test can help show whether low progesterone levels are causing female infertility (problems getting pregnant after a year of trying) or problems during pregnancy. The test may also help diagnose certain problems with the adrenal glands that may cause high levels of progesterone in both females and males. Other names: serum progesterone, progesterone blood test, PGSN1What is it used for? A progesterone test may be used to help: Find the cause of female infertility. Check to see if fertility treatments are working. Find out your risk of a miscarriage (loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks). Diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, which is a fertilized egg that tries to grow outside of the uterus. The egg cannot grow into a baby when it's in the wrong place. It must be removed to avoid damage to your organs. This can be a medical emergency. Check the health of a high-risk pregnancy. Diagnose ovarian cancer or problems with your adrenal glands. Normally, your adrenal glands make small amounts of progesterone. High levels of progesterone may be a sign of an adrenal gland disorder in both females and males.1Why do I need a progesterone test? You may need a progesterone test if: You are having trouble getting pregnant. A progesterone test can help your health care provider see if your ovaries are releasing eggs (ovulating) normally. You are having fertility treatments. You are having abnormal bleeding when you're not pregnant. You are pregnant and:

You're having progesterone therapy to prevent a miscarriage.
Your provider wants to check the health of your pregnancy because you have a higher risk for miscarriage or other pregnancy complications.
You have signs of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, such as cramps or bleeding

 You're having progesterone therapy to prevent a miscarriage. Your provider wants to check the health of your pregnancy because you have a higher risk for miscarriage or other pregnancy complications. You have signs of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, such as cramps or bleeding1What happens during a progesterone test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any other preparations for a progesterone test. In certain cases, you may need to know the first day of your last menstrual period. Your provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before the test. But never stop taking medicine unless your provider tells you.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? The meaning of your test results depends on: Why you had the test Where you were in your menstrual cycle when your blood sample was taken High progesterone levels: When you're not pregnant may be linked to:


A cyst on your ovaries
Ovarian cancer
Adrenal gland problems, including adrenal gland cancer, or an inherited disorder called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)

 A cyst on your ovaries Ovarian cancer Adrenal gland problems, including adrenal gland cancer, or an inherited disorder called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) Higher than expected  progesterone levels when you are pregnant, may mean you're having two or more babies. High progesterone levels may also be a sign of a molar pregnancy, which is an abnormal growth of tissue in the uterus. It's caused by a fertilized egg with such severe genetic problems that it cannot become a baby. The growth can turn into cancer and must be removed. Low progesterone levels: When you're not pregnant, may be linked to:


Not ovulating normally
Not having a menstrual period (amenorrhea)

 Not ovulating normally Not having a menstrual period (amenorrhea) When you're pregnant, may be linked to:


Ectopic pregnancy
Miscarriage or a high risk of miscarriage
Pre-eclampsia

 Ectopic pregnancy Miscarriage or a high risk of miscarriage Pre-eclampsia Your provider can explain what your test results say about your health. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a progesterone test? Because progesterone levels change throughout your pregnancy and menstrual cycle, you may need to be tested several times.1References Cable JK, Grider MH. Physiology, Progesterone.

Available from: https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/your-menstrual-cycle Prolactin Levels : 1What is a prolactin levels test? A prolactin (PRL) test measures the level of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone made by the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain. Prolactin causes the breasts to grow and make milk during pregnancy and after birth. Prolactin levels are normally high for pregnant women and new mothers. Levels are normally low for nonpregnant women and for men. If prolactin levels are higher than normal, it often means there is a type of tumor of the pituitary gland, known as a prolactinoma. This tumor makes the gland produce too much prolactin. Excess prolactin can cause the production of breast milk in men and in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding. In women, too much prolactin can also cause menstrual problems and infertility (the inability to get pregnant). In men, it can lead to lower sex drive and erectile dysfunction (ED). Also known as impotence, ED is the inability to get or maintain an erection. Prolactinomas are usually benign (noncancerous). But left untreated, these tumors can damage surrounding tissues. Other names: PRL test, prolactin blood test1What is it used for? A prolactin levels test is most often used to: Diagnose a prolactinoma (a type of tumor of the pituitary gland) Help find the cause of a woman's menstrual irregularities and/or infertility Help find the cause of a man's low sex drive and/or erectile dysfunction1Why do I need a prolactin levels test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a prolactinoma. Symptoms may include: Production of breast milk if you are not pregnant or breastfeeding Nipple discharge Headaches Changes in vision Other symptoms are different depending on whether you are a man or woman. If you are a woman, symptoms also depend on whether you have gone through menopause. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old. Symptoms of excess prolactin in women who have not gone through menopause include: Irregular periods Periods that have stopped completely before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause. Infertility Breast tenderness Women who have gone through menopause may not have symptoms until the condition worsens. Excess prolactin after menopause often causes hypothyroidism. In this condition, the body does not make enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include: Fatigue Weight gain Muscle pain Constipation Trouble tolerating cold temperatures Symptoms of excess prolactin in men include: Nipple discharge Breast enlargement Low sex drive Erectile dysfunction Decrease in body hair1What happens during a prolactin levels test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will need to take your test about three to four hours after waking up. Prolactin levels change throughout the day, but are usually the highest in early morning. Be sure to tell your health care provider about any medicines you are taking. Certain medicines can raise prolactin levels. These include birth control pills, high blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show higher than normal prolactin levels, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Prolactinoma (a type of tumor of the pituitary gland) Hypothyroidism A disease of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is an area of the brain that controls the pituitary gland and other body functions. Liver disease If your results show high prolactin levels, your health care provider may order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) test to get a closer look at your pituitary gland. High prolactin levels may be treated with medicine or surgery. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References Empower [Internet].

A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a blood test that measures the level of PSA in a sample of your blood. PSA is a protein made by your prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes the fluid part of semen. It's normal to have a low level of PSA in your blood. A high PSA level may be caused by: Prostate cancer An enlarged prostate (BPH) (benign prostatic hyperplasia) Other common prostate problems Taking certain medicines A PSA test can't show what is causing abnormal PSA levels. So, if your level is high, you may need other tests. Other names: total PSA free PSA1What is it used for? A PSA test is used to screen for prostate cancer. Cancer screening means looking for signs of cancer before it causes symptoms. But screening tests can't diagnose cancer. If a screening test finds signs of cancer, you'll need other tests to find out if you have cancer and how serious it may be. Most types of prostate cancer grow very slowly. They don't spread beyond the prostate and may never cause health problems. In fact, you can live a long life with prostate cancer and never know you have it. The goal of prostate cancer screening is to help find cancers that may be more likely to spread so they can be treated early. But there are challenges and possible harms from using a PSA test to screen for prostate cancer: A PSA test can't tell the different between abnormal PSA levels from prostate cancer and noncancerous conditions. If your PSA level is high, a prostate biopsy is the only way to find out if the cause is cancer. And prostate biopsies have possible harms. A PSA test may lead to finding and treating prostate cancer that would never have affected your health. If prostate cancer is found:


It can be difficult to tell the difference between slow-growing cancers and those that are likely to grow faster and spread in your body.
You could have prostate cancer treatment that you never really needed. And cancer treatment may cause serious harms, such as:


Erectile dysfunction
Urinary incontinence
Problems controlling your bowels (poop)



 It can be difficult to tell the difference between slow-growing cancers and those that are likely to grow faster and spread in your body. You could have prostate cancer treatment that you never really needed. And cancer treatment may cause serious harms, such as:


Erectile dysfunction
Urinary incontinence

 Erectile dysfunction Urinary incontinence Problems controlling your bowels (poop) To decide whether a PSA test to screen for prostate cancer is right for you, talk with your health care provider about: Your risk for developing a serious type of prostate cancer. If your risk is high, the possible benefits of finding cancer early may outweigh the possible harms. Your general health. Are you well enough to have treatment for prostate cancer if it's found? Your preferences. How do you feel about the possible benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment? PSA testing may also be used to: Help diagnose the cause of prostate conditions that aren't cancer Monitor treatment for a prostate condition, including cancer1Why do I need a PSA test? It's your choice whether to have a PSA test to screen for cancer. You and your prover may consider your risk for developing a serious cancer that could spread if you don't catch it early. Your risk for serious prostate cancer may be higher depending on your: Age. The risk of prostate cancer increases after age 50. Your family health history. If members of your family have had prostate cancer, your risk may be higher. Your race. Prostate cancer is more common in African Americans. They also have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer at a younger age and having more serious disease. You may also have a PSA test if: You have symptoms of a prostate condition, such as:

Painful or frequent urination (peeing)
Blood in urine or semen
Pelvic and/or back pain

 Painful or frequent urination (peeing) Blood in urine or semen Pelvic and/or back pain You have prostate cancer. Your provider may use PSA testing to monitor your condition or to see how well treatment is working.1What happens during a PSA test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will need to avoid having sex or masturbating for 24 hours before your PSA test. That's because releasing semen can increase your PSA levels, which may make your results less accurate. Also, certain medicines may affect your test results, so tell your provider about any medicines you take.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? There is no specific normal or abnormal level for PSA in blood. In general, the higher your PSA level, the more likely it is that you have cancer. But it's possible to have a high PSA without prostate cancer, or a low PSA with prostate cancer. If you had a PSA test for a prostate cancer screening or because you have prostate symptoms: High PSA levels can mean you have prostate cancer or a prostate condition that's not cancer, such as an infection (prostatitis) or an enlarged prostate. If your PSA levels are higher than normal, your provider may talk with you about having more tests to diagnose the cause. These tests may include:

Another PSA test, more commonly if you don't have any symptoms. PSA levels can go up and down, so it helpful to see if your PSA levels change over time.
A digital rectal exam (DRE). For this test, your provider inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for lumps or anything unusual.
A urine test. A sample of your urine is tested for infection.
A prostate biopsy. A biopsy is minor surgery. A doctor removes samples of tissue from your prostate so it can be studied under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only way to diagnose cancer. It may be recommended if your provider thinks you may have prostate cancer.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw5522 Protein C and Protein S Tests : 1What are protein C and protein S tests? Protein C and protein S are proteins in your blood that work together to prevent your blood from clotting too much. Tests of protein C and S use a sample of your blood to measure how much of these proteins you have and how well they're working. Problems with proteins C and S are called "deficiencies." Normally, your body makes blood clots to stop bleeding when you have an injury. If you have a protein C or a  protein S deficiency, your blood may clot even when you don't have an injury. The clots usually form in the veins in your legs or pelvis. This condition is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  If part of a blood clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs, it's called a pulmonary embolism. This condition can be life-threatening. Most protein C and protein S deficiencies are acquired. That means that the deficiency is caused by another health condition or certain medicines. Acquired protein C and S deficiencies may develop with: Infections Liver or kidney disease A lack of vitamin K Cancer and chemotherapy Certain medicines, including birth control pills and warfarin, a blood-thinner Pregnancy Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), a rare condition that causes blood clotting throughout the body, followed by bleeding In rare cases, protein C or protein S deficiencies are inherited. That means that your condition is caused by a change in a gene that one or both of your parents passed down to you. There are separate tests for protein C and S. But they are often done at the same time. Other names:  protein C antigen, protein S antigen, PC, PS, free PS, autoprothrombin IIA1What are they used for? Protein C and protein S tests are used to: Find the cause of a blood clot that can't be explained and check your risk for developing more blood clots in the future. Check for a protein C or S deficiency. Check your protein C or S levels to see if they've gotten better or worse. This is done if you have had a change in the health condition that is causing a protein C or S deficiency.1Why do I need protein C and protein S tests? You may need to test protein C and S if you: Had a blood clot before the age of 50 without a known reason Had a blood clot in an unusual location, such as in the veins of your kidneys, liver, or brain Have had several blood clots In certain cases, you may need testing if you have a family member who has a serious inherited protein C or S deficiency or who had a clot at a young age. Testing may also be needed for a newborn with a clotting disorder.1What happens during protein C and protein S testing? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you are having protein C and S tests because you had a blood clot, you must wait until you have fully recovered to have this test. If you have the test too soon, the results will not be accurate. Your provider will let you know when you're ready to be tested. Your provider may tell you to not to take blood thinners (medicine that helps prevents blood clots) for several days or longer before your test. But never stop any prescription medicine without talking with your provider first.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Higher than normal levels of protein C or S are not known to cause any health problems. Lower than normal levels of protein C or S, or proteins that aren't working well, mean that you have a higher risk of developing a blood clot. Your level of risk depends on how abnormal your test results are. If your provider thinks your protein C or S deficiency is inherited, you may need a genetic test to find out for sure. Having an inherited deficiency doesn't mean that you'll develop a blood clot. But it does mean that your risk for developing a clot will be increased for the rest of your life. If your protein C or S deficiency is acquired, the deficiency may be temporary or long-lasting. In certain cases, acquired deficiencies may get worse over time. With both inherited and acquired deficiencies, treatment may help reduce your risk of developing blood clots. Your provider may recommend treatment depending on your test results and health history. You may be able to lower your risk of blood clots by: Taking medicines (blood thinners, also called "anticoagulants") to help prevent too much clotting Treating the condition that caused an acquired deficiency Avoiding other things that can increase your risk of blood clots, including:

Smoking
Birth control pills

 Smoking Birth control pills If you have questions about your results or how to manage a protein C or S deficiency, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about protein C and protein S tests? If you have been diagnosed with a protein C or S deficiency, it's important to talk with your provider whenever you face situations that can trigger blood clots, such as: Surgery Pregnancy Broken bones or other trauma injuries Not moving for long periods of time due to:

Bedrest
Long car rides or airplane trips

 Bedrest Long car rides or airplane trips Your provider can help you reduce your risk of getting a clot during those higher-risk times.1References Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Protein S Deficiency [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/aa68134 Protein in Urine : 1What is a Protein in Urine Test? A protein in urine test measures protein is in your urine (pee). Normally, you have very little protein in your urine. A large amount of protein in urine (proteinuria) may mean that you have a problem with your kidneys. Kidneys are organs that filter extra water and wastes out of your blood to make urine. Proteins are large molecules that are essential for your body to work properly. Protein is found in all parts of your body, including your blood. When your kidneys clean waste from your blood, tiny filters prevent the large protein molecules from leaving your body through urine. If there is a problem with your kidneys, protein can leak into your urine. High levels of protein in your urine over a period of time may be the first sign that kidney disease or another condition has damaged the filters in your kidneys. A protein in urine test can help you find kidney damage early so you can make changes to protect your kidneys. Other names: urine protein, 24-hour urine protein; urine total protein; ratio; reagent strip urinalysis1What is it used for? A protein in urine test is often part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and substances in your urine. Urinalysis is used to check your general health. This test may also be used to diagnose or monitor kidney disease and many other types of health problems.1Why do I need a protein in urine test? Your health care provider may order a protein in urine test as part of your regular checkup, or if you have symptoms of kidney disease. With some types of kidney disease, such as chronic kidney disease, you may not have symptoms until the later stages of the disease. These symptoms include: Swelling in the hands and feet or puffy eyelids Dry skin, itching or numbness Fatigue Increased or decreased urination Urine that is bloody or foamy Loss of appetite and weight loss Muscle cramps Nausea and vomiting Shortness of breath Sleep problems Trouble thinking clearly Protein in urine may be an early sign of kidney disease before you even have symptoms. So your provider may order a protein in urine test if you have a high risk for kidney disease. You're more likely to develop kidney disease if you have: A family history of kidney disease Diabetes High blood pressure Heart disease Taking certain prescription and over-the-counter medicines can damage your kidneys, too. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium) can harm the kidneys if you take them for a long period or if you have certain medical conditions. Talk with your provider about your risk for kidney disease.1What happens during a protein in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test. In certain cases, your provider may ask you to collect all of your urine during a 24-hour period. A "24-hour urine sample test" may provide more complete results, because the amount of protein and other substances in urine can vary throughout the day.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations to test for protein in urine. If your provider has ordered a 24-hour urine sample, you will get specific instructions on how to provide and store your samples.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a urine in protein test.1What do the results mean? If a large amount of protein is found in your urine sample, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Strenuous exercise, dehydration, diet, stress, pregnancy, and other conditions can cause a temporary rise in urine protein levels. Your provider may recommend other urinalysis tests to see whether you continue to have a high level of protein in your urine over time.  If your urine protein remains high, it is likely a sign of kidney disease or kidney damage from other conditions. The amount of protein in your urine is linked to the amount of kidney damage you may have. But you will need more tests to diagnose what is causing the damage. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a protein in urine test? At-home test kits that check for protein in urine test are available without a prescription. The kits usually include dipsticks and instructions for how to collect and test your urine sample. At-home urine tests are easy to do and provide accurate results as long as you carefully follow all instructions. Ask your provider which protein in urine test is best for you.1References Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diseases & Conditions [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c2022.

A prothrombin time (PT) test measures how long it takes for a clot to form in a blood sample. An INR (international normalized ratio) is a type of calculation based on PT test results. Prothrombin is a protein made by the liver. It is one of several substances known as clotting (coagulation) factors. When you get a cut or other injury that causes bleeding, your clotting factors work together to form a blood clot. How fast your blood clots depends on the amount of clotting factors in your blood and whether they're working correctly. If your blood clots too slowly, you may bleed too much after an injury. If your blood clots too fast, dangerous clots may form in your arteries or veins. A PT/INR test helps diagnose the cause of bleeding or clotting disorders. It also checks to see if a medicine that prevents blood clots is working the way it should. Other names: prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, PT protime1What is it used for? A PT/INR test is most often used to: See how well warfarin is working. Warfarin is a blood-thinning medicine that's used to treat and prevent dangerous blood clots. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Find out the reason for abnormal blood clots Find out the reason for unusual bleeding Check clotting function before surgery Check for liver problems A PT/INR test is often done along with a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test. A PTT test also checks for clotting problems.1Why do I need a PT/INR test? You may need this test if you are taking warfarin on a regular basis. The test helps make sure you are taking the right dose. If you are not taking warfarin, you may need this test if you have symptoms of a bleeding or clotting disorder. Symptoms of a bleeding disorder include: Unexplained heavy bleeding Bruising easily Unusually heavy nose bleeds Unusually heavy menstrual periods in women Symptoms of a clotting disorder include: Leg pain or tenderness Leg swelling Redness or red streaks on the legs Trouble breathing Cough Chest pain Rapid heartbeat In addition, you may need a PT/INR test if you are scheduled for surgery. It helps make sure your blood is clotting normally, so you won't lose too much blood during the procedure.1What happens during a PT/INR test? The test may be done on a blood sample from a vein or a fingertip. For a blood sample from a vein: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a blood sample from a fingertip: A fingertip test may be done in a provider's office or in your home. If you are taking warfarin, your provider may recommend you test your blood regularly using an at-home PT/INR test kit. During this test, you or your provider will: Use a small needle to puncture your fingertip Collect a drop of blood and place it onto a test strip or other special instrument Place the instrument or test strip into a device that calculates the results. At-home devices are small and lightweight. If you are using an at-home test kit, you will need to review your results with your provider. Your provider will let you know how he or she would like to receive the results.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you are taking warfarin, you may need to delay your daily dose until after testing. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any other special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you were tested because you are taking warfarin, your results will probably be in the form of INR levels. INR levels are often used because they make it easier to compare results from different labs and different test methods. If you are not taking warfarin, your results may be in the form of INR levels or the number of seconds it takes for your blood sample to clot (prothrombin time). If you are taking warfarin: INR levels that are too low may mean you are at risk for dangerous blood clots. INR levels that are too high may mean you are at risk for dangerous bleeding. Your health care provider will probably change your dose of warfarin to reduce these risks. If you are not taking warfarin and your INR or prothrombin time results were not normal, it may mean one of the following conditions: A bleeding disorder, a condition in which the body can't clot blood properly, causing excessive bleeding A clotting disorder, a condition in which the body forms excessive clots in arteries or veins Liver disease Vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K plays an important role in blood clotting. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a PT/INR test? Sometimes certain liver tests are ordered along with a PT/INR test.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw203083 PTEN Genetic Test : 1What is a PTEN genetic test? A PTEN genetic test looks for a change, known as a mutation, in a gene called PTEN. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father. The PTEN gene helps stop the growth of tumors. It's known as a tumor suppressor. A tumor suppressor gene is like the brakes on a car. It puts the "brakes" on cells, so they don't divide too quickly. If you have a PTEN genetic mutation, it can cause the growth of noncancerous tumors called hamartomas. Hamartomas can show up throughout the body. The mutation can also lead to the development of cancerous tumors. A PTEN genetic mutation can be inherited from your parents, or acquired later in life from the environment or from a mistake that happens in your body during cell division. An inherited PTEN mutation can cause a variety of health disorders. Some of these can start at infancy or early childhood. Others show up in adulthood. These disorders are often grouped together and called PTEN hamartoma syndrome (PTHS) and include: Cowden syndrome, a disorder that causes the growth of many hamartomas and increases the risk of several types of cancer, including cancers of the breast, uterus, thyroid, and colon. People with Cowden syndrome often have a larger than normal sized head (macrocephaly), developmental delays, and/or autism. Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome also causes hamartomas and macrocephaly. In addition, people with this syndrome may have learning disabilities and/or autism. Males with the disorder often have dark freckles on the penis. Proteus or Proteus-like syndrome can cause an overgrowth of bones, skin, and other tissues, as well as hamartomas and macrocephaly. Acquired (also known as somatic) PTEN genetic mutations are one of the commonly found mutations in human cancer. These mutations have been found in many different types of cancer, including prostate cancer, uterine cancer, and some types of brain tumors. Other names: PTEN gene, full gene analysis; PTEN sequencing and deletion/duplication1What is it used for? The test is used to look for a PTEN genetic mutation. It is not a routine test. It is usually given to people based on family history, symptoms, or previous diagnosis of cancer, especially cancer of the breast, thyroid, or uterus.1Why do I need a PTEN genetic test? You or your child may need a PTEN genetic test if you have a family history of a PTEN genetic mutation and/or one or more of the following conditions or symptoms: Multiple hamartomas, especially in the gastrointestinal area Macrocephaly (larger than normal sized head) Developmental delays Autism Dark freckling of the penis in males Breast cancer Thyroid cancer Uterine cancer in females If you've been diagnosed with cancer and don't have a family history of the disease, your health care provider may order this test to see if PTEN genetic mutation may be causing your cancer. Knowing whether you have the mutation can help your provider predict how your disease will develop and guide your treatment. Some cancers caused by PTEN mutations may be treated with targeted therapy. Targeted therapies attack specific areas or substances in cancer cells. These therapies may be more effective and cause fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy.  1What happens during a PTEN genetic test? A PTEN test is usually a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for a PTEN test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show you have a PTEN genetic mutation, it does not mean you have cancer, but your risk is higher than most people. But more frequent cancer screenings can reduce your risk. Cancer is more treatable when found in the early stages. If you have the mutation, your health care provider may recommend one or more of the following screening tests: Colonoscopy, starting at age 35–40 Mammogram, starting at age 30 for women Monthly breast self-exams for women Yearly uterine screening for women Yearly thyroid screening Yearly check of skin for growths Yearly kidney screening Yearly thyroid and skin screenings are also recommended for children with a PTEN genetic mutation. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a PTEN genetic test? If you've been diagnosed with a PTEN genetic mutation or are thinking about getting tested, it may help to speak to a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. If you haven't yet been tested, the counselor can help you understand the risks and benefits of testing. If you have been tested, the counselor can help you understand the results and direct you to support services and other resources.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=34&contentid=16421-1 Pulse Oximetry : 1What is pulse oximetry? Pulse oximetry is a test that uses a small, clip-like device called a pulse oximeter to measure oxygen levels in the blood. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen and send it into your bloodstream. This oxygen-rich blood is carried into your heart, which pumps it to the rest of your body. If your blood oxygen level (oxygen saturation) is too low, it can make it hard for your body to work properly. It can put a dangerous strain on your vital organs. Pulse oximetry is a painless and quick way to find out if your oxygen level is too low. Quick treatment of low blood oxygen may help you avoid serious complications. Other names: pulse ox, oxygen saturation monitor, finger pulse oximeter1What is it used for? Pulse oximetry is used to check your blood oxygen level. The test may be done in a provider's office, clinic, hospital, or even your own home. An at-home pulse oximeter may be useful if you have a serious and/or chronic lung disease.1Why do I need pulse oximetry? Your provider may give you a pulse-oximetry test as part of a routine checkup, or if you: Have a condition that affects lung function. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, heart failure, and COVID-19. Are taking medicine to treat lung disease. The test can show how well the medicine is working. Are having surgery. Your blood oxygen level may be checked before, during, and after your procedure. Have sleep apnea. This condition causes you to briefly stop breathing during sleep. You may have repeated episodes of breathing interruptions during a single night's sleep There can be as many as 30 episodes per hour.1What happens during pulse oximetry? During pulse oximetry: A small electronic device called a pulse oximeter will be clipped to a part of your body,  usually a fingertip. The oximeter uses a special type of light that passes through your skin and into your blood. A sensor on the oximeter measures the amount of light. That measurement is used to figure out your blood oxygen level. After a few seconds, the oximeter will provide a readout of your heart rate and oxygen level. If you have a condition that affects lung function, your health care provider may recommend you use an at-home finger pulse oximeter or other oximeter to monitor your condition. Your provider will guide you on how to purchase and use your at-home device.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you or your provider is using a finger pulse oximeter, you should remove any fingernail polish. Nail polish can block the light emitted from the oximeter.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having pulse oximetry.1What do the results mean? Results are often given as oxygen saturation levels. A normal oxygen saturation level ranges between 95 percent and 100 percent. Saturation levels may be somewhat lower and considered acceptable if you have a lung disease such as COPD or pneumonia. Levels may also be lower if you live in an area with higher elevation. If you are using an at-home oximeter, you should contact your health care provider if your oxygen saturation level is 92 percent or lower. If it falls to 88 percent or lower, seek immediate medical attention. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about pulse oximetry? Pulse oximetry results may be 2 to 4 percent higher or lower than your actual blood oxygen level. For a more accurate result, your provider may do a blood test called an arterial blood gas. But this test can be painful. It also cannot be used at home or for continuous monitoring. You may need both types of tests to manage your condition.1References American Lung Association [Internet].

Rapid tests, also known as rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs, are easy-to-use tests that provide quick results, usually in 20 minutes or less. Unlike most standard tests, which have to be sent to a lab, rapid tests are done and provide results at the point of care. The point of care is the place where you are getting care. It can include your provider's office, a clinic, or even your own home. Rapids tests usually include the following steps: You will provide a sample of your body fluid, such as blood, urine, saliva, or nasal secretions. The sample is mixed with a special substance that will cause a chemical reaction if a disease or other condition is present. Results will show on a dipstick or rapid test cassette.

A dipstick is a thin, plastic strip that's coated with chemicals. If the test is positive, the dipstick will change colors when placed in the sample.
A rapid test cassette is a small, plastic case that has a well that holds the sample. The well will show a letter or a symbol to indicate the result.

A rapid test cassette is a small, plastic case that has a well that holds the sample. The well will show a letter or a symbol to indicate the result. Most rapid tests are highly accurate, but the results are not always as accurate as standard lab tests.  Other names: rapid diagnostic tests, RDT's point-of-care tests1How are they used? Rapid tests are most often used to diagnose infectious diseases, including: Flu Strep throat Malaria HIV COVID 19. Rapid tests for COVID-19 usually provide results in about 30 minutes. Rapid tests are also used in certain home-based tests, such as pregnancy tests.1What are the advantages and disadvantages of rapid tests? The advantages of rapid tests include: Fast results. This may allow you to get treatment faster. Faster treatment can reduce the severity of your symptoms, and may help prevent the spread of disease Easy to use. They can be done by non-medical workers and volunteers who have been trained to do the test.  You may even be able to perform a rapid test on yourself. Little or no special equipment required. This is especially useful in areas with limited resources or access to specialized labs. Disadvantages of rapid tests: Lower sensitivity than lab tests. Sensitivity means how well a test can identify a disease or condition. Rapid tests are not as good as lab tests at finding diseases in the earliest stages of infection. False negatives are more common. A false negative result means your test shows you don't have a disease or condition, but you actually do have it. Providers will often take a second sample and send it to a lab for testing to confirm or rule out the results of a rapid test. But you may be able to get treatment and help prevent the spread of disease while you wait for lab results.111111Is there anything else I need to know about rapid tests? Home based rapid tests are available for COVID-19. Like other rapid tests, the rapid COVID-19 tests have lower sensitivity than standard lab tests. But getting fast, home-based results may help prevent the spread of disease. Talk to your health care provider to learn more about these home-based tests.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/simple-rapid-tests Rash Evaluation : 1What is a rash evaluation? A rash evaluation is a test to find out what is causing a rash. A rash, also known as dermatitis, is an area of skin that is red, irritated, and usually itchy. A skin rash may also be dry, scaly, and/or painful. Most rashes happen when your skin touches a substance that irritates it. This is known as contact dermatitis. There are two main types of contact dermatitis: allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis happens when your body's immune system treats a normally harmless substance as if it were a threat. When exposed to the substance, the immune system sends out chemicals in response. These chemicals affect your skin, causing you to develop a rash. Common causes of allergic contact dermatitis include: Poison ivy and related plants, like poison sumac and poison oak. A poison ivy rash is one of the most common types of contact dermatitis. Cosmetics Fragrances Jewelry metals, such as nickel. Allergic contact dermatitis usually causes itching that can be severe. Irritant contact dermatitis happens when a chemical substance damages an area of skin. This causes a skin rash to form. Common causes of irritant contact dermatitis include: Household products such as detergents and drain cleaners Strong soaps Pesticides Nail polish remover Body fluids, such as urine and saliva. These rashes, which include diaper rash, most commonly affect babies. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy. In addition to contact dermatitis, a rash may be caused by: Skin disorders, such as eczema and psoriasis Infections such as chicken pox, shingles, and measles Insect bites Heat. If you get overheated, your sweat glands can get blocked. This can cause a heat rash. Heat rashes often happen in hot, humid weather. While it can affect people of any age, heat rashes are most common in babies and young children. Other names: patch test, skin biopsy1What is it used for? A rash evaluation is used to diagnose the cause of a rash. Most rashes can be treated at home with over-the-counter anti-itch creams or antihistamines. But sometimes a rash is a sign of a more serious condition and should be checked by a health care provider.1Why do I need a rash evaluation? You may need a rash evaluation if you have rash symptoms that aren't responding to at-home treatment. Symptoms of a contact dermatitis rash include: Redness Itching Pain (more common with an irritant rash) Dry, cracked skin Other types of rashes may have similar symptoms. Additional symptoms vary depending on the cause of the rash. While most rashes are not serious, in some cases a rash can be a sign of a serious health condition. Call your health care provider if you or your child has a skin rash with any of the following symptoms: Severe pain Blisters, especially if they affect the skin around the eyes, mouth, or genitals Yellow or green fluid, warmth, and/or red streaks in the rash area. These are signs of infection. Fever. This could be a sign of a viral or bacterial infection. These include scarlet fever, shingles, and measles. Sometimes a rash can be the first sign of a severe and dangerous allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Call 911 or seek immediate medical attention if: The rash is sudden and spreads quickly You have trouble breathing Your face is swollen1What happens during a rash evaluation? There are different ways to do a rash evaluation. The type of test you get will depend on your symptoms and medical history. To test for allergic contact dermatitis, your health care provider may give you a patch test: During a patch test: A provider will place small patches on your skin. The patches look like adhesive bandages. They contain small amounts of specific allergens (substances that cause an allergic reaction). You'll wear the patches for 48 to 96 hours and then return to your provider's office. Your provider will remove the patches and check for rashes or other reactions. There is no test for irritant contact dermatitis. But your provider may make a diagnosis based on a physical exam, your symptoms, and information you provide about your exposure to certain substances. A rash evaluation may also include a blood test and/or a skin biopsy. During a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. During a biopsy: A provider will use a special tool or a blade to remove a small piece of skin for testing.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test. These include antihistamines and antidepressants. Your health care provider will let you know which medicines to avoid and how long you need to avoid them before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a patch test. If you feel intense itching or pain under the patches once you are home, remove the patches and call your health care provider. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After a biopsy, you may have a little bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the biopsy site. If these symptoms last longer than a few days or they get worse, talk to your provider.1What do the results mean? If you had a patch test and have itchy, red bumps or swelling at any of the testing sites, it means you are probably allergic to the substance tested. If you had a blood test, abnormal results may mean you: Are allergic to a certain substance Have a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection If you had a skin biopsy, abnormal results may mean you: Have a skin disorder such as psoriasis or eczema Have a bacterial or fungal infection If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a rash evaluation? To relieve symptoms of a skin rash, your provider may suggest over-the-counter medicines and/or at-home treatments, such as cool compresses and cool baths. Other treatments will depend on your specific diagnosis.1References American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology [Internet]. Milwaukee (WI): American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology; c2020.

Available from: https://www.yalemedicine.org/stories/skin-biopsy RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width) : 1What is a Red Cell Distribution Width Test? A red cell distribution width (RDW) test measures the differences in the volume and size of your red blood cells (erythrocytes). Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, make new cells, and stay healthy. Normally, your red blood cells are all about the same size. A high RDW means that there's a major difference between the size of your smallest and largest red blood cells. This may be a sign of a medical condition. Other names: RDW-SD (standard deviation) test, Erythrocyte Distribution Width1What is it used for? The RDW blood test is often part of a complete blood count (CBC), a test that measures many different parts of your blood, including red cells. The RDW test is commonly used to help diagnose anemia, a condition in which your red blood cells can't carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body. The RDW test may also be used with other tests to help diagnose other conditions, including thalassemia, an inherited disease that can cause severe anemia.1Why do I need an RDW test? Your health care provider may have ordered a complete blood count, which includes an RDW test, as part of a routine exam, or if you have: Symptoms of anemia, including weakness, dizziness, pale skin, and cold hands and feet A family history of thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or other inherited blood disorder A chronic illness such as Crohn's disease, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS A diet low in iron and other minerals A long-term infection Excessive blood loss from an injury or surgical procedure1What happens during an RDW test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This process generally takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? No special preparation is necessary.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? RDW results help your provider understand how much your red blood cells vary in size and volume. Even if your RDW results are normal, you may still have a medical condition that needs treatment. That's why your provider will usually look at your RDW results along with the results of other blood tests. The combined test results can show a more complete picture of your red blood cells to help diagnose a variety of conditions, including: Iron deficiency Different types of anemia Thalassemia Sickle cell anemia A high RDW result can also be a sign of other conditions, such as: Chronic liver disease Heart disease Diabetes Kidney disease Cancer, especially colorectal cancer Your provider will most likely need more tests to confirm a diagnosis. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a red cell distribution width test? If your test results indicate you have a chronic blood disorder, such as anemia, you may be put on a treatment plan to increase the amount of oxygen that your red blood cells can carry. Depending on your specific condition, your provider may recommend iron supplements, medicines, and/or changes in your diet. Be sure to talk to your provider before taking any supplements or making any changes in your eating plan.1References Lee H, Kong S, Sohn Y, Shim H, Youn H, Lee S, Kim H, Eom H.

A red blood cell (RBC) count measures the number of red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. An RBC count that is higher or lower than normal is often the first sign of an illness. So the test may allow you to get treatment even before you have symptoms. Other names: erythrocyte count, red count1What is it used for? A red blood cell (RBC) count is almost always part of a complete blood count, a group of tests that measure many different parts and features of your blood. The RBC measurement is used to help diagnose red blood cell disorders, such as anemia, a condition in which your body does not make enough healthy red blood cells.1Why do I need a red blood cell count? You may get this test as part of a complete blood count, which is often included in a routine checkup. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of a low or high red blood cell count. Symptoms of a low red blood cell count include: Weakness Fatigue Pale skin Rapid heartbeat Symptoms of a high red blood cell count include: Headache Dizziness Vision problems1What happens during a red blood cell count? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You don't need any special preparations for a red blood cell (RBC) count.1Are there any risks to this test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will show whether you have a normal red blood cell count or a count that is too low or too high. A low red blood cell count can be a sign of: Anemia Leukemia, a type of blood cancer Malnutrition, a condition in which your body does not get the calories, vitamins, and/or minerals needed for good health Multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow Kidney failure It may also be a sign of pregnancy. A high red blood cell count can be a sign of: Dehydration Heart disease Polycythemia vera, a bone marrow disease that causes too many red blood cells to be made Scarring of the lungs, often due to cigarette smoking Lung disease Kidney cancer If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an RBC count? If results showed you had a low or a high red blood cell count, you may need more tests to help make a diagnosis. These include: Reticulocyte count, a test that counts the number of reticulocytes in the blood. Reticulocytes are red blood cells that are still developing. These are also known as immature red blood cells. Iron tests, which measure iron levels in the blood. Iron is essential for making red blood cells. Vitamin B test, which measures the amount of one or more B vitamins in the blood. B vitamins are important for making red blood cells.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

Red blood cell (RBC) indices measure the size, shape, and quality of your red blood cells. Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. There are four types of red blood cell indices: Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which measures the average size of your red blood cells Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), which measures the average amount of hemoglobin in a single red blood cell. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which also measures hemoglobin in red blood cells. In addition, it includes a calculation of the size and volume of your red blood cells. Red cell distribution width (RDW), which measures differences in the volume and size of your red blood cells. If one or more of these indices are not normal, it may mean you have some type of anemia, a condition in which your body does not make enough healthy red blood cells. Other names: erythrocyte indices1What are they used for? Red blood cell (RBC) indices are part of a complete blood count, a group of tests that measures various parts and features of your blood. The results of RBC indices are used to diagnose different types of anemia. There are several types of anemia, and each type has a different effect on the size, shape, and/or quality of red blood cells.1Why do I need red blood cell indices testing? You may get this test as part of a complete blood count, which is often included in a routine checkup. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of anemia, which include: Weakness Fatigue Pale skin Rapid heartbeat Cold hands and feet Shortness of breath1What happens during a red blood cell indices test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This test usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests? You don't need any special preparations for a red blood cell (RBC) indices.1Are there any risks to these tests? There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? You will get results for each of the indices. Abnormal results may include one or more of the following: Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) If your red blood cells are smaller than normal, it may mean you have: Iron deficiency anemia, the most common form of anemia. It happens when you don't have enough iron in your body. Thalassemia, an inherited disease that can cause severe anemia If your red blood cells are larger than normal, it may mean you have: Anemia caused by a vitamin B deficiency Liver disease Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) If the amount of hemoglobin is lower than normal, it may mean you have: Iron deficiency anemia If the amount of hemoglobin is higher than normal, it may mean you have: High level of cholesterol in the blood Anemia caused by a vitamin B deficiency Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) If the average amount of hemoglobin is lower than normal, it may mean you have: Iron deficiency anemia Thalassemia If the average amount of hemoglobin is higher than normal, it may mean you have: Hemolytic anemia, a type of anemia that happens when red blood cells are broken up in the blood stream Hereditary spherocytosis, a rare genetic disorder that causes anemia and gallstones Red cell distribution width (RDW) If your results were normal, it means your red blood cells are normal in size and are all about the same size. If your results were not normal, it means there are differences in the size of your red blood cells. This measurement is not enough to make a diagnosis, so RDW results are usually combined with the results of other indices and other blood tests. The combination of results can help confirm a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

An RBC (red blood cell) antibody screen is a blood test that looks for RBC antibodies in your blood. These antibodies destroy red blood cells that are different from your own (foreign). Having RBC antibodies won't harm your health, but: If you have a blood transfusion, they could cause serious illness. If you are pregnant, they could harm your baby. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to attack germs and other foreign substances in your body, including some foreign red blood cells. Blood transfusions and pregnancy are two ways that you may come into contact with foreign red blood cells. Your immune system reacts to foreign red blood cells when they have markers, called antigens, that are unlike the antigens on your own cells. The unfamiliar antigens trigger your immune system to make RBC antibodies to destroy the foreign red blood cells. An RBC antibody screen can find these antibodies before they cause health problems. Other names: antibody screen, indirect antiglobulin test, indirect anti-human globulin test, IAT, indirect coombs test, erythrocyte Ab, RBC antibody identification1What is it used for? An RBC antibody screen is used to check your blood for RBC antibodies before you have a blood transfusion or when you're pregnant: Before a blood transfusion, the test can help show whether donor blood is compatible (well matched) with your blood. If your blood has antibodies to the donor blood, your immune system will attack the red blood cells in the transfusion. This type of immune reaction can make you seriously ill. An RBC antibody screen helps match you to blood that won't cause a harmful reaction. 
During pregnancy, the test can show whether you have RBC antibodies that could attack your unborn baby's red blood cells, causing a very serious type of anemia in the baby. Antibodies that may cause this problem in pregnancy, include Rh antibodies and Kell antibodies.
The most common cause of anemia in babies is called Rh incompatibility. Rh factor is a red blood cell antigen that you inherit from your parents. If you don't have Rh antigens on your blood cells, but your unborn baby does, then you have Rh incompatibility. If your blood mixes with your baby's blood, you will make RBC antibodies that attack your baby's blood.
Early in your pregnancy, or even before you're pregnant, you'll have a prenatal blood test to find out whether you have the Rh antigen:


If you don't have Rh antigens, you are Rh-negative. If the baby's biological father is Rh-positive (has Rh antigens), or their blood type is unknown, you will be treated as if you and your baby have Rh incompatibility. That's because most people are Rh positive.
Usually, Rh incompatibility doesn't cause problems in your first pregnancy. That's because it takes time for your body to make antibodies, and exposure to the baby's blood mostly happens during childbirth, if at all. But Rh antibodies could cause problems in future pregnancies, or if you need a blood transfusion.
An RBC antibody screen checks whether you've made antibodies that could affect your current pregnancy or a future pregnancy. If you haven't made any, you may have treatment that will prevent your body from making Rh antibodies.

If you have Rh antigens, you are Rh positive. Your immune system will not make Rh antibodies, so you won't have Rh incompatibility. But you may still have an RBC antibody screen to look for other less common red blood cell antibodies that could also affect your baby.

An RBC antibody screen may also look for antibodies to Kell antigens. Kell antigens are a group of red blood cell antigens that can trigger a strong immune response if you don't have Kell antigens in your own blood. In most cases, Kell RBC antibodies develop over time after exposure through several blood transfusions. But you may also make Kell RBC antibodies during pregnancy if your baby has Kell antigens and you don't. Kell antibodies can cause a very severe anemia that may be life-threatening for an unborn baby.1Why do I need an RBC antibody screen? Your health care provider may order an RBC screen if you need a blood transfusion or if you're pregnant. An RBC antibody screen is usually done in early pregnancy, as part of routine prenatal testing. If you have Rh-negative blood, you may need to have another RBC antibody screen later in your pregnancy.1What happens during an RBC antibody screen? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an RBC screen.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you are getting a blood transfusion: The RBC screen results will help identify the type of donor blood that best matches yours: A positive result means you have one or more RBC antibodies in your blood that could attack red blood cells in certain types of donor blood. You will likely need more tests to find out exactly what type of RBC antibodies you have. This information will help find donor blood that won't trigger your immune system to destroy the red blood cells in the transfusion. A negative result means no RBC antibodies were found. If you are pregnant: The RBC screen will show whether your blood has any antibodies that could harm your baby. A negative result means that no RBC antibodies were found. If you have Rh-negative blood, you may be given an injection (shot) to prevent your body from making Rh antibodies that could harm your current baby or a baby in a future pregnancy. A positive test result means that you have RBC antibodies in your blood. You will likely need more tests to find out what type of RBC antibodies you have.

If you have Rh antibodies, you may have more frequent tests during your pregnancy to check the health of your baby.
If you have other RBC antibodies, but not Rh antibodies, your pregnancy will be closely watched. If you have Rh-negative blood, you may still have an injection to prevent your body from making Rh antibodies that could harm this baby or a baby in a future pregnancy.

 If you have Rh antibodies, you may have more frequent tests during your pregnancy to check the health of your baby.

Most people are Rh positive, which does not cause blood incompatibility and poses no health risks. Once you have RBC antibodies, they never go away. But you may have too few to show up on a test. If have had an RBC antibody screen that showed you have RBC antibodies, make sure to tell your provider, especially if you need a blood transfusion or are pregnant.1References ACOG: The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw3681 Renin Test : 1What is a renin test? This test measures the level of renin in the blood. Renin is a hormone made by the kidneys. It controls the production of another hormone called aldosterone, which is made in the adrenal glands. These are two small glands located above the kidneys. Aldosterone helps manage blood pressure and maintain healthy levels of potassium and sodium in the body. If renin and/or aldosterone levels are not normal, it can be a sign of a serious adrenal gland disorder. Because the two hormones work together, an aldosterone test is often done at the same time as a renin test. Other names: renin blood test, plasma renin activity (PRA) aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR)1What is it used for? A renin test (or renin and aldosterone test) is used to find out if the adrenal glands are making too much or too little aldosterone. The test is especially useful in diagnosing primary aldosteronism (PA), a disease that happens from having too much aldosterone. PA, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism or Conn syndrome, causes high blood pressure. If not treated, high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure.1Why do I need a renin test? You may need a renin test if you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, especially if it doesn't respond well to standard blood pressure medicines. The test can show whether PA is causing the condition. Sometimes PA causes low potassium levels, so you may also need this test if you have symptoms of low potassium. These include: Cramps Weakness Excessive thirst Fatigue Headache1What happens during a renin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You may be asked to stop taking certain medicines two to four weeks before your test. These include: Birth control pills Blood pressure medicines Diuretics (water pills) You may also be asked to follow a low-salt diet for three days before your test.1Are there any risks to this test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show a higher than normal amount of renin, it may mean you have: Addison disease, a condition in which your adrenal glands don't make enough of certain hormones Cirrhosis, scarring of the liver Dehydration If your results show a lower than normal amount of renin, it may mean you have: Primary aldosteronism (PA) Kidney disease Most often, your renin test results will be compared with aldosterone test results. These results may show one of the following: Lower than normal renin/Lower than normal aldosterone. This may mean you have Cushing's syndrome, a disorder in which the adrenal glands make too much of a hormone called cortisol. Lower than normal renin/Higher than normal aldosterone. This may mean you have PA. Higher than normal renin/Lower than normal aldosterone. This may mean you have Addison disease. Higher than normal renin/Higher than normal aldosterone. This may mean you have secondary aldosteronism. In this disorder, a medical condition in another part of the body causes the adrenal glands to make too much aldosterone. These conditions include diseases of the heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on your results, your provider may recommend medicine and/or diet and lifestyle changes to treat your condition. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a renin test? Licorice can affect your test results, so you should not eat licorice for at least two weeks before your test. But only real licorice, which comes from licorice plants, has this effect. Most licorice products sold in the U.S. don't contain any real licorice. Check the package ingredient label to be sure.1References Cigna [Internet]. Bloomfield (CT): Cigna; c2021.

A respiratory pathogens (RP) panel checks for pathogens in the respiratory tract. A pathogen is a virus, bacteria, or other organism that causes an illness. Your respiratory tract is made up of parts of the body involved in breathing. This includes your lungs, nose, and throat. There are many types of viruses and bacteria that can infect the respiratory tract. Symptoms are often similar, but treatment can be very different. So it's important to make the right diagnosis. Other viral and bacterial tests for respiratory infections are often limited to testing for one specific pathogen. Several samples may be needed. The process can be difficult and time consuming. An RP panel only needs a single sample to run tests for a wide variety of viruses and bacteria. Results usually come in a few hours. Results from other types of respiratory tests can take a few days. Faster results may allow you to get started earlier on the right treatment. Other names: RP panel, respiratory virus profile, syndromic multiplex panel1What is it used for? A respiratory pathogens panel is used to help diagnose: Viral infections, such as: Flu Common cold Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This is a common and usually mild respiratory infection. But it can be dangerous to babies and the elderly. Adenovirus infection. Adenoviruses cause many different types of infections. These include pneumonia and croup, an infection that causes hoarse, barking coughs. COVID-19  Bacterial infections, such as: Whooping cough Bacterial pneumonia1Why do I need a respiratory pathogens panel? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a respiratory infection and are at risk for complications. Most respiratory infections cause mild to moderate symptoms. But the infections can be serious or even life threatening to young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms of a respiratory infection include: Coughing Trouble breathing Sore throat Stuffy or runny nose Fatigue Loss of appetite Fever1What happens during a respiratory pathogens panel? There are two ways a provider may take a sample for testing: Nasopharyngeal swab: You will tip your head back. Your health care provider will insert a swab into your nostril until it reaches the upper part of your throat. Your provider will rotate the swab and remove it. Nasal aspirate: Your provider will inject a saline solution into your nose, then remove the sample with gentle suction.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a respiratory pathogens panel.1Are there any risks to the test? The swab test may tickle your throat or cause you to cough. The nasal aspirate may be uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.1What do the results mean? A negative result may mean your symptoms were caused by a pathogen not included in the panel of tests. It may also mean you have a condition not caused by a virus or bacteria. A positive result means a specific pathogen was found. It tells you which type of infection you have. If more than one part of the panel was positive, it means you may be infected with more than one pathogen. This is known as a co-infection. Based on your results, your provider will recommend treatment and/or order more tests. These may include a bacteria culture, viral blood tests, and a Gram stain. The tests may help confirm your diagnosis and guide treatment. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Clinical Lab Manger [Internet]. Clinical Lab Manager; c2020.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/rsp11 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Tests : 1What is an RSV test? RSV stands for respiratory syncytial virus. It is an infection that affects the respiratory tract. Your respiratory tract includes your lungs, nose, and throat. RSV testing checks a fluid sample from your nose to see if the RSV virus is causing symptoms of a respiratory infection. RSV is very contagious, which means it spreads easily from person to person. It's also very common. Most children get RSV by the age of two. RSV usually causes mild symptoms that are like a cold. But the virus may lead to serious breathing problems, especially in certain groups of people, including: Infants, especially those 6 months and younger Older adults, especially those 65 years and older People with heart or lung diseases People with weakened immune systems Two types of tests are commonly used to diagnose RSV infections: Rapid RSV antigen tests are the most common test for RSV. They check a fluid sample from your nose for certain proteins from the RSV virus called antigens. RSV antigens trigger your immune system to attack the virus. Rapid antigen tests can provide results in an hour or less. Molecular tests called RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests look for genetic material from the RSV virus in your sample. These tests can find smaller amounts of the virus than antigen tests. So, RT-PCR tests may be used for older children and adults who tend to have less of the virus in their noses than infants and younger children. Samples are usually sent to a lab for testing. In certain cases, your provider may order a molecular test called a respiratory pathogens panel. This test checks for RSV and other respiratory viruses and bacterial infections at the same time. Other names: respiratory syncytial antibody test, RSV rapid detection1What is it used for? An RSV test is usually used to see if RSV is the cause of moderate to severe cold symptoms in infants, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. People with mild symptoms may be tested as part of public health efforts to track the spread of the virus. The test is usually done during the "RSV season," the time of year when RSV outbreaks are more common. In the United States, RSV season usually starts in mid-fall and ends in early spring, but the season may vary in different parts of the country.1Why do I need an RSV test? Healthy adults and older children usually don't need RSV testing. Most RSV infections only cause mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, and headaches. But an infant, younger child, or an adult over age 65 may need an RSV test if they have symptoms of moderate or serious infection. These include: Fever Wheezing Serious cough Breathing faster than normal or trouble breathing Blue skin color In infants less than six months old, the only symptoms of RSV may be: Acting cranky or irritable Moving less than usual Lack of appetite Pauses in breathing1What happens during an RSV test? Tests to diagnose RSV are done on a sample of fluid from your nose. There are different ways to collect the sample: Nasal aspirate or wash. This is the most common way to collect a sample for RSV testing. To do a nasal aspirate, a health care professional will insert a saline solution (salt water) into your nose and remove it with gentle suction. Nasal swab test. A health care professional will use a special swab to take a sample from your nose. RSV test samples should be taken during the first few days after symptoms begin. That's because the amount of the virus in your nose decreases over time, which may make test results less accurate. At-home test kits are available to buy without a prescription. The test checks for RSV, flu, and COVID-19 using one sample. The kit includes a nasal swab to collect the sample to send to a lab for testing. Talk with your provider about using an at-home test. Blood tests aren't usually used to diagnose RSV, but they can show if a recent illness was an RSV infection. So public health officials may use blood tests to measure the size of an RSV outbreak in the community.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an RSV test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to RSV testing. A nasal aspirate or wash may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary. A swab test may cause a gagging feeling or brief discomfort when your nose is swabbed.1What do the results mean? A negative result means that no signs of the RSV virus were found in your sample. They may mean that another illness is causing your symptoms. But a negative test result does not rule out RSV. It's possible that there was not enough of the virus in the sample for the test to find it. A positive result means that you likely have an RSV infection. Infants, young children and older adults may need treatment in the hospital if they are having trouble breathing or have lost too much fluid and become dehydrated. Treatment may include oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. In the most serious cases, a breathing machine called a ventilator may be needed, but this is uncommon. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an RSV test? If you have RSV symptoms, but are otherwise in good health, your provider probably won't order RSV testing. Most healthy adults and children with RSV will get better in 1-2 weeks. Your provider may recommend over-the-counter medicines and drinking plenty of fluids to relieve your symptoms. Talk with your child's provider before giving your child any medicines.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

They are also known as immature red blood cells. Reticulocytes are made in the bone marrow and sent into the bloodstream. About two days after they form, they develop into mature red blood cells. These red blood cells move oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. A reticulocyte count (retic count) measures the number of reticulocytes in the blood. If the count is too high or too low, it can mean a serious health problem, including anemia and disorders of the bone marrow, liver, and kidneys. Other names: retic count, reticulocyte percent, reticulocyte index, reticulocyte production index, RPI1What is it used for? A reticulocyte count is most often used to: Diagnose specific types of anemia. Anemia is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal amount of red blood cells. There are several different forms and causes of anemia. See if treatment for anemia is working See if bone marrow is producing the right amount of blood cells Check bone marrow function after chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant1Why do I need a reticulocyte count? You may need this test if: Other blood tests show your red blood cell levels are not normal. These tests may include a complete blood count, hemoglobin test, and/or hematocrit test. You are being treated with radiation or chemotherapy You recently received a bone marrow transplant You may also need this test if you have symptoms of anemia. These include: Fatigue Weakness Shortness of breath Pale skin Cold hands and/or feet Sometimes new babies are tested for a condition called hemolytic disease of the newborn. This condition happens when a mother's blood is not compatible with her unborn baby. This is known as Rh incompatibility. It causes the mother's immune system to attack the baby's red blood cells. Most pregnant women are tested for Rh incompatibility as part of routine prenatal screening.1What happens during a reticulocyte count? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.  This usually takes less than five minutes. To test a newborn, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a reticulocyte count test.1Are there any risks to the test?  After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is very little risk to your baby with a needle stick test. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show a higher than normal amount of reticulocytes (reticulocytosis), it may mean: You have hemolytic anemia, a type of anemia in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the bone marrow can replace them. Your baby has hemolytic disease of the newborn, a condition that limits the ability of a baby's blood to carry oxygen to organs and tissues. If your results show a lower than normal amount of reticulocytes, it may mean you have: Iron deficiency anemia, a type of anemia that happens when you don't have enough iron in your body. Pernicious anemia, a type of anemia caused by not getting enough of certain B vitamins (B12 and folate) in your diet, or when your body can't absorb enough B vitamins. Aplastic anemia, a type of anemia that happens when the bone marrow isn't able to make enough blood cells. Bone marrow failure, which may be caused by an infection or cancer. Kidney disease Cirrhosis, scarring of the liver These test results are often compared with results of other blood tests. If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a reticulocyte count? If your test results were not normal, it doesn't always mean you have anemia or other health problems. Reticulocyte counts are often higher during pregnancy. Also you may have a temporary increase in your count if you move to a location with a high altitude. The count should return to normal once your body adjusts to the lower oxygen levels that happen in higher altitude environments.1References American Society of Hematology [Internet].

A rheumatoid factor (RF) test looks for rheumatoid factor (RF) in a sample of your blood. Rheumatoid factors are proteins made by the immune system. Normally, your immune system makes proteins called antibodies to attack germs that could make you sick. But rheumatoid factors are antibodies that sometimes attack healthy cells and tissues in your body by mistake. When this happens, you have an autoimmune disorder. Not everyone has rheumatoid factors in their blood. And some people who have them are healthy. But if you have certain symptoms and higher levels or rheumatoid factors, you may have an autoimmune disorder or another health problem related to high RF levels. RF testing is mostly used with other tests to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a type of autoimmune disorder that damages your joints and causes pain, swelling, and stiffness. It is a chronic (long-lasting) condition that can also affect your organs and cause other symptoms. High levels of rheumatoid factors may also be a sign of other autoimmune disorders, certain infections, and certain types of cancer. Other names: RF Blood Test1What is it used for? An RF test is often used to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders. RF testing may also be used to understand how severe rheumatoid arthritis may be and whether it's likely to affect organs. An RF test alone can't diagnose any health problems.1Why do I need an RF test? You may need an RF test if you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms often begin in the wrists, hands, and feet. They usually affect the same joints on both sides of the body and tend to come and go. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: Joint pain Tenderness, swelling, and warmth of the joint Joint stiffness that lasts longer than 30 minutes Fatigue Occasional low fevers Loss of appetite Problems outside of the joints that may include dry eyes or mouth, firm lumps under the skin, or anemia You may also need an RF test if you're having tests to diagnose another condition that can cause high levels of rheumatoid factor, such as: Other autoimmune disorders, including:

Sjögren syndrome
Lupus
Scleroderma
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and teens

 Sjögren syndrome Lupus Scleroderma Juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and teens Chronic infections, including:

Hepatitis C (liver)
Tuberculosis (mostly affects the lungs)
Endocarditis (heart)

 Hepatitis C (liver) Tuberculosis (mostly affects the lungs) Endocarditis (heart) Certain types of cancer, including leukemia1What happens during an RF test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. At-home tests for rheumatoid factor are available. The test kit provides everything you need to collect a sample of blood by pricking your finger. You'll mail your sample to a lab for testing. If you do a home test, it's important to share your results with your health care provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an RF test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? An RF test alone cannot diagnose any conditions. To make a diagnosis, your provider will look at the results of other tests along with your symptoms and medical history. A negative (normal) result means that you have little or no rheumatoid factor in your blood. But that doesn't rule out rheumatoid arthritis or another health problem. Many people with rheumatoid arthritis have little or no rheumatoid factor. If you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but your RF test results are normal, your provider may order more tests to make a diagnosis. A positive (abnormal) result means that a higher level of rheumatoid factor was found in your blood. This doesn't always mean that rheumatoid factors are causing your symptoms. But the higher your RF test results, the more likely it is that you have a condition linked to rheumatoid factors. Your provider may do more tests to find out if you have: Rheumatoid arthritis or another autoimmune disease A chronic infection Certain cancers Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an RF test? An RF test is not used to diagnose osteoarthritis. Although rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis both affect the joints, they are very different diseases. Osteoarthritis is not  an autoimmune disease and does not involve rheumatoid factor. Researchers aren't sure what causes osteoarthritis. It mostly affects older adults.1References Arthritis Foundation [Internet]. Atlanta: Arthritis Foundation; Rheumatoid Arthritis; [updated 2021 Oct 15; cited 2022 Jun 3]; [about 9 screens].

Salicylates are a type of drug found in many over-the-counter and prescription medicines. Aspirin is the most common type of salicylate. Popular brand name aspirins include Bayer and Ecotrin. Aspirin and other salicylates are most often used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. They also are effective in preventing excessive blood clotting, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. People at risk for these disorders may be advised to take baby aspirin or other low-dose aspirin daily to help prevent dangerous blood clots. Even though it's called baby aspirin, it's not recommended for babies, older children, or teens. For these age groups, aspirin can cause a life-threatening disorder called Reye syndrome. But aspirin and other salicylates are usually safe and effective for adults when taken at the proper dose. However, if you take too much, it can cause a serious and sometimes fatal condition called salicylate or aspirin poisoning. Other names: acetylsalicylic acid level test, salicylate serum test, aspirin level test1What is it used for? A salicylates level test is most often used to: Help diagnose acute or gradual aspirin poisoning. Acute aspirin poisoning happens when you take much aspirin at once. Gradual poisoning happens when you take lower doses over a certain period of time. Monitor people taking prescription-strength aspirin for arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. The test can show whether you are taking enough to treat your disorder or are taking a harmful amount.1Why do I need a salicylates level test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of acute or gradual aspirin poisoning. Symptoms of acute aspirin poisoning usually happen three to eight hours after an overdose and may include: Nausea and vomiting Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Sweating Symptoms of gradual aspirin poisoning may take days or weeks to show up and may include: Rapid heartbeat Fatigue Headache Confusion Hallucinations1What happens during a salicylates level test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you regularly take aspirin or other salicylate, you may need to stop taking it for at least four hours before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any other special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to a salicylates level test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show a high level of salicylates, you may need immediate treatment. If levels get too high, it can be fatal. The treatment will depend on the amount of overdose. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a salicylates level test? A daily dose of low-dose or baby aspirin used to be recommended as a way to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke for many older adults. But daily aspirin use may cause bleeding in the stomach or brain. That is why it is no longer recommended for adults without heart disease risk factors. Because heart disease is usually more dangerous than the complications from bleeding, it may still be recommended for those at high risk. Risk factors for heart disease include family history and  previous heart attack or stroke. Before you stop or start taking aspirin, be sure to talk with your health care provider.1References Cleveland Clinic [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c1995–2020.

A semen analysis, also called a sperm count, measures the quantity and quality of semen and sperm. Semen is the thick, white fluid released from the penis during sexual climax (orgasm). This release is called ejaculation. Semen contains sperm, the cells made in the male reproductive system  that include the genetic material needed to make a baby. If you and your partner haven't been able to get pregnant, a problem with semen or sperm may be one of the reasons. Problems such as a low sperm count or sperm that don't move properly can cause infertility, which is the inability to conceive a baby after a year of trying. A semen analysis can help figure out if a problem with semen or sperm is likely to be causing infertility. Other names: sperm count, sperm analysis, semen testing, male fertility test1What is it used for? A semen analysis is used to find out if a problem with semen or sperm may be causing infertility.  The test may also be used to see if a vasectomy has been successful. A vasectomy is a surgery on the male reproductive system that's done for birth control. To prevent pregnancy, a vasectomy cuts the tubes that carry sperm out of your testicles (testes) so that the sperm can't get into your semen. A semen analysis is usually done 8 to 16 weeks after a vasectomy to make sure your semen has no sperm.1Why do I need a semen analysis? You may need a semen analysis if: You and your partner have been trying to have a baby for at least 12 months without success. You've recently had a vasectomy and need to make sure that you don't have any sperm in your semen.1What happens during a semen analysis? You will need to provide a semen sample. For accurate the results, the semen must be examined quickly before the sperm begin to die. For this reason, you will usually provide a sample in a private room at a lab by masturbating and collecting your semen in a sterile container. You may be asked to urinate (pee) and wash your hands and penis before collecting your sample. This will help keep bacteria from your skin out of the sample. To get accurate results: Don't use lubricants or saliva because they could harm your sperm. Make sure to collect all the semen you produce. If you miss collecting even a bit of it, you should let your provider know. If you prefer, you may be able to collect your sample at home during sex by using a special type of condom that your provider gives you. But you will have to keep the sample at body temperature and take it to the lab within 30 to 60 minutes after collecting it. You may need to provide two or more semen samples within a week or two. That's because your sperm count and semen quality can vary from day to day. Talk with your provider if you have questions or concerns about providing a semen sample.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You'll need to avoid all sexual activity that results in ejaculating sperm for 2-7 days before the sample is collected. This will help make sure your sperm count is at its highest level. Your provider will give you exact instructions.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to a semen analysis.1What do the results mean? Results to check fertility: Your semen analysis will include many measurements that describe your semen and sperm: Volume is the amount of semen in your sample. A low volume may cause infertility. Sperm count is the number of sperm in the entire sample. A low count may make it difficult to get your partner pregnant. Sperm concentration measures how close together the sperm are in your semen.  A low concentration may be a sign of a problem. Sperm movement (motility) tells you the percentage of sperm that are moving forward. Sperm must be able to move forward to fertilize an egg. Sperm shape (morphology) is the number of sperm that have a normal shape. Sperm with abnormal shapes may not be able to fertilize an egg. pH describes the acidity of your semen. Abnormal acidity can kill sperm or affect their ability to move. White blood cells (leukocytes) in sperm may be a sign that an infection is affecting your fertility. If your semen analysis results aren't all normal, it doesn't mean you're permanently infertile. But it does show that your sperm may be part of the problem you and your partner are having getting pregnant. Your provider may order more tests to help find the cause of the problem so it can be treated. There are many possible causes, including: Certain habits you may be able to change, such as smoking A physical problem in your testicles, such as an enlarged vein (varicocele) Certain genetic disorders or other health conditions, including hormone disorders, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis Treatments for infertility depend on the cause. To help improve your chances of having a baby, your provider may refer you to a doctor who specializes in infertility. Results for semen analysis to check a vasectomy: The results of your semen analysis will tell you if there's any sperm in your semen. It's not unusual to find sperm in several ejaculations after a successful vasectomy. If sperm is found, you'll need repeat testing until your sample has no sperm. In the meantime, you and your partner will have to use other birth control to prevent pregnancy. If no sperm is found, you and your partner should be able to stop using other forms of birth control. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a semen analysis? There are several at-home kits that measure sperm count alone. Some kits provide more information, but none of them provide as much information as you get from an analysis that your provider orders. With at-home self-test kits, you collect a semen sample and use the kit to do a sperm count on your own. Some kits also use a device that attaches to a smartphone to check how the sperm are moving and how dense they are in your semen. With self-collection kits, you collect a semen sample at home to send to a lab. These tests provide more information than tests you do at home, but they don't replace a more complete semen analysis that your provider orders.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a test that checks lymph nodes for cancer cells. Lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system, a network of organs and vessels that help the body fight infections and other diseases. Lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including the underarms, neck, chest, abdomen, and groin. Certain cancers, such as breast cancer and melanoma (the most dangerous form of skin cancer), can spread through the lymphatic system. Cancers spread when cells break off from the original tumor and are carried to other parts of the body. The sentinel lymph node is the first node where these types of cancers are most likely to spread. The node is usually located near the site of the original tumor. Sometimes there is more than one sentinel lymph node. A sentinel lymph node biopsy can show how likely it is that your cancer is spreading (metastasizing). Other names: lymph node biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy1What is it used for? A sentinel lymph node biopsy is used to find out whether an early-stage cancer has spread through the lymphatic system. It's most often used for people who have breast cancer or melanoma.1Why do I need a sentinel lymph node biopsy? You may need this test if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, melanoma, or certain other types of cancer. It can show whether your cancer is spreading.1What happens during a sentinel lymph node biopsy? A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done in a hospital or an outpatient surgical center. The procedure usually includes a special type of imaging test called lymphoscintigraphy. Lymphoscintigraphy takes pictures of the lymphatic system and is used to locate the sentinel lymph node. The procedure includes the following steps: A health care provider will apply medicine to numb the skin over the procedure area. You will be injected with a small amount of a radioactive substance called a tracer near the tumor. The tracer will travel and collect in the sentinel lymph node, or nodes. You may also be injected with a blue dye that stains the lymph node, making it easier to see. You will be given general anesthesia. General anesthesia is a medicine that makes you unconscious. It makes sure you won't feel any pain during the surgery. A specially trained doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you this medicine. Once you're unconscious, a camera will take images of the area. The camera finds and records the location of the tracer, which will have settled in the sentinel node. The node will be removed and sent to a lab, where it will be checked for cancer cells. This part of the test is known as a biopsy. The original tumor is also usually removed during the procedure.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. You may also need to stop taking blood thinners, such as aspirin, for a certain time before your test. Your provider will let you know when you need to stop taking your medicine and anything else you need to do to prepare for the test. In addition, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home. You may be groggy and confused after you wake up from the procedure.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have a little bleeding, pain, or bruising at the biopsy site. There is also a small risk of infection, which can be treated with antibiotics. Allergic reactions to the tracer are rare and usually mild. There is very little exposure to radiation in a sentinel lymph node biopsy. While radiation exposure from the tracer in a sentinel lymph node biopsy is safe for most adults, it can be harmful to an unborn baby. So be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.1What do the results mean? The results will be given as positive or negative. If your results are positive, it means cancer was found and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes and/or other organs. Your provider may recommend removing and testing more lymph nodes to check for cancer cells. If your results are negative, it means no cancer cells were found, and it's unlikely that the cancer has spread. You will not need to have any more lymph nodes removed. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a sentinel lymph node biopsy?

This test measures the levels of SHBG in a sample of your blood. SHBG stands for sex hormone binding globulin. It's a protein made mostly in your liver. It binds (attaches) to sex hormones in your blood. SHBG helps control the amount of sex hormones that are actively working in your body. When the SHBG protein binds to sex hormones, your tissues can't use those hormones. Your tissues can only use sex hormones that are "free," which means they aren't attached to proteins, such as SHBG. An SHBG test is usually done if you have signs and/or symptoms of having too much or too little of the sex hormone testosterone. Testosterone is known as a "male" sex hormone, but females have testosterone in smaller amounts. In adult males, testosterone controls sex drive, maintains muscle mass, and helps make sperm. In adult females, testosterone is important for healthy organs and the growth of bones and muscles. Measuring SHBG levels can provide information about how much of your testosterone is active in the tissues of your body. Other names: testosterone-estrogen binding globulin, TeBG1What is it used for? SHBG testing is most often used to gather information about how testosterone is working in the body for: Adult males who have symptoms that may be caused by too little testosterone Adult females who have symptoms that may be caused by too much testosterone Usually, your health care provider will order a total testosterone blood test first. This test provides one measurement of all the testosterone in your blood sample, which includes free testosterone plus testosterone that's attached to proteins. But this test doesn't show how much of your testosterone is free for your body to use. So, you could have symptoms from too little or too much free testosterone even when your total testosterone level is normal. If your total testosterone level doesn't explain your symptoms, your provider may order an SHBG blood test to help learn how much free testosterone you have. SHBG and total testosterone tests may also be done at the same time.1Why do I need an SHBG blood test? You may need this test if you have signs and/or symptoms of abnormal testosterone levels, especially if results from a total testosterone test didn't explain your symptoms. If you're male, you may need this test if you have symptoms of low testosterone levels, including: Low sex drive Difficulty getting an erection Fertility problems If you're female, you may need this test if you have symptoms of high testosterone, including: Too much hair growth on the face and body Deepening of voice Having menstrual periods that aren't regular or no periods at all Acne Weight gain Fertility problems1What happens during an SHBG blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an SHBG test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your provider will usually look at your SHBG blood test results along with the results of a total testosterone test. This helps your provider estimate how much free testosterone is in your blood. If your SHBG levels are too low, it means that more of your total testosterone is likely to be available for your body to use. Low levels of SHBG may be related to: Hypothyroidism Type 2 diabetes Obesity or being very overweight Overuse of steroid medicines and/or anabolic steroids Cushing's syndrome In females, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It's also normal for SHBG levels to decrease with older age as the production of sex hormones also decreases. If your SHBG levels are too high, it likely means that less of your total testosterone is free testosterone that's available for your tissues to use. So, your tissues may not be getting enough testosterone. High levels of SHBG may be related to: Liver disease Hyperthyroidism Eating disorders In females, using estrogen in medicine, such as:

Hormone replacement therapy
Birth control pills

 Hormone replacement therapy Birth control pills In males, reduced production of sex hormones Your provider may order other tests to check if your hormones are in balance with each other. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an SHBG blood test? An SHBG test may be used with other tests to help diagnose early puberty in children. Normally, SHBG levels are high in all children. The high levels prevent sex hormones from affecting body tissues. If SHBG levels are low, children may start puberty too early.1References Accesa Labs [Internet]. El Segundo (CA): Acessa Labs; c2022.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw27307 Skin Biopsy : 1What is a skin biopsy? A skin biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of skin for testing. The procedure can help diagnose a skin lesion (an abnormal area of skin). The skin sample is looked at under a microscope to check for skin cancer, a variety of skin conditions, or skin infections. Only certain skin lesions need a biopsy. Your provider may be able to diagnose many types of lesions just by looking at them. There are three main ways to do a skin biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on the location, size, and depth of the skin lesion: A shave biopsy removes a sample from the top layers of skin with a razor blade or scalpel (a small cutting blade used for surgery). Your provider will do a shave biopsy if your condition appears to involve only the top layers of skin. A punch biopsy uses a special tool with a round blade to remove the skin sample. Your provider will do a punch biopsy if your condition appears to involve the deep layers of skin. An excisional biopsy uses a scalpel to remove all of the skin lesion, usually with some normal skin around it. The sample may include the full thickness of the skin along with fat below the skin. Most skin biopsies can be done in a health care provider's office or other outpatient facility. Other names: punch biopsy, shave biopsy, excisional biopsy, skin cancer biopsy, basal cell biopsy, squamous cell biopsy, melanoma biopsy1What is it used for? A skin biopsy is used to help diagnose a variety of skin conditions including: Skin disorders such as psoriasis, eczema, actinic keratosis ("precancers"), and warts. Bacterial or fungal infections of the skin. Skin cancer. A biopsy can confirm or rule out whether a suspicious mole or other growth is cancer. If the result is cancer, the biopsy can show what type of skin cancer it is. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. The two most common types of skin cancer are basal cell and squamous cell cancers. These cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body and can usually be cured with treatment. In many cases, the biopsy removes all the cancer, and no other treatment is needed. The most serious type of skin cancer is melanoma. It's more likely than other skin cancers to spread to other parts of your body, including to your organs. Most deaths from skin cancer are caused by melanoma. A skin biopsy can help diagnose skin cancer in the early stages, when it's easier to treat.1Why do I need a skin biopsy? You may need a skin biopsy if you have certain skin symptoms, such as: A rash that doesn't go away Scaly or rough skin Open sores that won't heal A mole or skin growth that has changed in its shape, color, or size A mole or new growth that has the "A-B-C-D-Es" of melanoma:

Asymmetrical - the shape is not regular
Border - the edge is jagged
Color - the color is uneven
Diameter - the size is larger than a pea
Evolving - the mole or growth has changed in the past few weeks or months

 Asymmetrical - the shape is not regular Border - the edge is jagged Color - the color is uneven Diameter - the size is larger than a pea Evolving - the mole or growth has changed in the past few weeks or months Blistering skin, which may be a sign of pemphigus, an autoimmune disease1What happens during a skin biopsy? A provider will clean the site and give you an injection (shot) to numb your skin so you won't feel any pain. For a punch biopsy: A provider uses a special tool with a hollow, round blade. The blade is placed over the abnormal skin area (lesion) and rotated to remove a small piece of skin about the size of a pencil eraser. The sample is lifted out with another tool. If a larger skin sample is taken, you may need one or two stitches to close the wound. Pressure will be applied to the wound until the bleeding stops. The wound will be covered with a bandage. A punch biopsy is often used to diagnose rashes. For a shave biopsy: A provider will use a razor or a scalpel to remove a sample from the top layer of your skin. To help stop the bleeding, pressure will be applied to the wound, or medicine may be spread over the wound. The wound will be covered with a bandage. A shave biopsy is often used if your provider thinks you may have basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or if you have a rash appears to affect only the top layer of your skin. For an excisional biopsy: A doctor will use a scalpel to remove the entire skin lesion, usually with some normal skin around it called "a margin." If the skin lesion is large, your provider may remove only a piece of it. This is called an incisional biopsy. The doctor will close the wound with stitches. Pressure will be applied to wound until the bleeding stops. The wound will be covered with a bandage. An excisional biopsy is often used if your provider thinks you may have melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. It may also be used for basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer. After the biopsy, keep the area covered with a bandage until you've healed or until your stitches come out. If you had stitches, they will be taken out 3-14 days after the biopsy.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a skin biopsy.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have a little bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the biopsy site. If these symptoms last longer than a few days or they get worse, tell your provider. Infection is possible, so it's important to keep the wound clean until it heals. Your provider will tell you how to care for your wound. You may have a scar after healing.1What do the results mean? A normal biopsy result means no cancer or skin disease was found. An abnormal biopsy result may diagnose a specific skin condition. But sometimes abnormal results aren't clear, and you may need more tests to find out exactly what condition you have. Your provider can explain what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a skin biopsy? If your provider thinks you may have a basal cell or squamous cell cancer, the entire lesion may be removed during the biopsy.  Often, the biopsy removes the entire cancer and no other treatment is needed. If you are diagnosed with melanoma, you will need more tests to see if the cancer has spread. Then you and your health care provider can develop a treatment plan that's right for you.1References American Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: American Cancer Society Inc.; c2022.

Cancer screening is checking for signs of cancer before you have any symptoms. A skin cancer screening includes looking at all of your skin to check for signs of skin cancer. Signs of skin cancer can be seen with just your eyes. Skin cancer is very common, and screening can help find it when it's easier to treat. Your health care provider can do a skin cancer screening, and you can also check your skin yourself. To do a skin cancer screening, you or your provider check your skin for moles, birthmarks, or other areas that have an unusual color, size, shape, or texture. If an area of skin doesn't look normal, you may need tests to find out if it's cancer. The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell and squamous cell cancers. These cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body and treatment usually cures them. Melanoma is a less common type of skin cancer, but it's more serious. That's because it's more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of your body. It can be harder to cure and may be fatal. Melanoma is easier to cure if it's found when it's growing only in the top layer of skin. And it's less likely to be fatal when it's treated early. Other names: skin exam1What is it used for? Skin cancer screening is used to look for signs of skin cancer. It's not used to diagnose cancer. If a screening test finds signs of skin cancer, you may need to have a test called a skin biopsy to find out whether you have cancer.1Why do I need a skin cancer screening? Some medical experts recommend checking your own skin regularly starting at age 18. That's because skin cancer is very common, and people of all skin colors can get it. A skin cancer screening with your provider or with a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin disorders) may be important if you: Find a suspicious area of skin during a self-exam. Have had skin cancer in the past. In this case, it's usually recommended to have a regular yearly skin cancer screening with your provider or a dermatologist Have a higher-than-normal risk for getting skin cancer:

Your risk for all types of skin cancer is higher if you have:

Had frequent exposure to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight, such as tanning beds
Pale skin that burns and freckles easily
Skin that tans a little or not at all
Blond or red hair
Light colored eyes, including blue or green


Your risk for basal cell or squamous cell cancer is higher if you have had:

Actinic keratosis, patches of thick, scaly skin
Radiation therapy for cancer
A weakened immune system
Exposure to arsenic


Your risk for melanoma is higher if you:

Had many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager
Have a personal and/or family health history of melanoma
Have a family health history of unusual moles, such as Gorlin syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum
Have several large or many small moles

For a self-exam to screen for skin cancer, you'll check your skin to look for: Changes in the size, shape, or color of an existing mole or spot Moles or other skin spots that ooze, bleed, or become scaly or crusty Moles that are painful to the touch Sores that haven't healed within two weeks Shiny pink, red, pearly white, or translucent bumps The "ABCDEs" of melanoma, which stands for:


Asymmetry: Does the mole or spot have an irregular shape with two parts that look very different?
Border: Is the border of the mole ragged or irregular?
Color: Is the color uneven?
Diameter: Is the mole or spot bigger than the size of a pea or a pencil eraser?
Evolving: Has the mole or spot changed during the past few weeks or months?

Diameter: Is the mole or spot bigger than the size of a pea or a pencil eraser? Evolving: Has the mole or spot changed during the past few weeks or months? To do a head-to-toe self-exam: Choose a well-lit room with a full-length mirror. You'll also need a hand-held mirror. Check you scalp. Part your hair and look with a hand mirror. It may also help to use a blow dryer to move your hair as you look. Check the back of your neck, too. Look at your face, ears, and front of your neck. Look at the front of your chest and belly. Lift breasts to check the skin underneath. Raise your arms and check the skin on your left and right sides, including your underarms. Look at the front and back of your arms. Check your hands, including between your fingers and fingernails (without nail polish). Check your back and buttocks with a hand mirror. Sit down to check the front and sides of your legs and use the hand mirror to check the backs of your legs and your genitals. Check your feet, including the bottoms, the spaces between your toes, and the nail of each toe (without nail polish). For a skin cancer screening by a provider, you'll remove your clothing and put on a gown. Your provider will do a full exam that includes your scalp, behind your ears, fingers, buttocks, and feet. Your provider may use a special magnifying glass with a light to look more closely at certain moles or spots. The exam should take 10-15 minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You should not wear makeup or nail polish. You will need to have your hair loose so your scalp can be checked.1Are there any risks to the test? Skin cancer screening isn't always helpful and may have risks. You may want to discuss these possible risks with your provider: Your screening test could find a cancer that would never cause health problems. Not all skin cancers cause symptoms or threaten your life. But if they're found during screening, you may have cancer treatment which could cause side effects. Finding advanced skin cancer may not help you live longer. Advanced skin cancer is cancer that's unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment. It may have spread to other parts of your body. Finding advanced skin cancer during a screening may not change how the cancer affects you. Your screening test results could show that you have skin cancer, but you really don't. This is called a "false positive." If you have a false positive, you may have other tests that have risks, such as a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy may cause scarring. Thinking you have cancer may also make you feel anxious. Your skin cancer screening result could be normal, but you have skin cancer. This is called a "false negative." A false negative may delay your medical care for the cancer.1What do the results mean? If you find a mole or other spot on your skin that concerns you, contact your provider. If you or your provider finds a sign of skin cancer, you'll probably have a skin biopsy to find out whether you have cancer. A skin biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of skin for testing. The skin sample is checked under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Not all suspicious spots turn out to be skin cancer. If the biopsy shows that you do have skin cancer, your provider will talk with you about your treatment options. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a skin cancer screening? There are mobile phone apps that use the camera of your phone to check skin moles and spots to help find skin cancer. These apps need to be studied to see if they are accurate and useful for skin cancer screening.1References American Academy of Dermatology Association [Internet].

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=85&ContentID=P01342 Sleep Study : 1What is a sleep study? A sleep study, also known as polysomnography, is a test that measures and records different body functions while you sleep. These include: Breathing rate Blood oxygen Heart rate Brain waves Leg movements Eye movements The test is used to diagnose sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are conditions that cause problems with sleeping. These include trouble falling asleep, getting too much sleep, and irregular breathing during sleep. Sleep disorders can affect your overall health, safety, and quality of life. Lack of sleep may increase your risk of serious conditions such as depression, diabetes, and heart disease. It may also lead to car crashes and other accidents. Early diagnosis and treatment of a sleep disorder may help you avoid health complications. Other names: polysomonography, sleep apnea study, home sleep study1What is it used for? A sleep study is used to diagnose sleep disorders. Common sleep disorders include: Sleep apnea, a condition that causes you to briefly stop breathing during sleep. You may have several repeated episodes of breathing interruptions during a single night's sleep. There can be as many as 30 episodes per hour. Insomnia, a disorder that can make it hard for you to fall asleep and/or stay asleep throughout the night. Restless leg syndrome, a condition that causes uncomfortable feelings in your legs and a strong urge to move them while you try to fall asleep Narcolepsy, a neurologic condition. It causes extreme sleepiness in the daytime. It may also cause you to suddenly fall asleep during the day.1Why do I need a sleep study? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a sleep disorder, such as: Loud snoring during sleep Waking up from sleep and gasping for breath Trouble falling and/or staying asleep Daytime sleepiness1What happens during a sleep study? A sleep study may be done at a hospital or a sleep study clinic, or in your own home. A home sleep study, also known as a sleep apnea study, is used to help diagnose sleep apnea. It does not diagnose other types of sleep disorders. During a study at a hospital or sleep clinic: You will arrive at the hospital or clinic in the evening and stay overnight.  You may bring your own bedclothes to wear. You will stay in a private, comfortable bedroom, similar to a hotel room. The room will have a private bathroom. Many sleep study rooms will have a low-light video camera to record your sleep movements during the night. A health care provider will attach electrodes (small metal disks) to your scalp, eyelids, chin, chest, and legs. The electrodes will be connected to a computer with wires. The wires will be long enough to allow you to move during sleep. The electrodes will record different body functions, such as breathing, heart rate, and brain waves. They'll also record your leg and eye movements. A small clip will also be placed on your finger or ear to monitor the level of oxygen in your blood. This is known as pulse oximetry. The lights will be turned off. While you sleep, specially trained providers known as polysomnography technologists will monitor you through the night. They'll watch for when you fall asleep and check your breathing, heart rate, and other body functions. If you need assistance during the night, you can talk to a polysomnography technologist through the monitoring equipment. You will be woken up in the morning, and your electrodes will be removed. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your night's sleep. During a home sleep study: You will pick up sleep study equipment at your provider's office, or it may be delivered to you Your provider will give you thorough instructions on how to use the equipment. Be sure to ask questions if you're unsure about anything. On the night of your study, you will attach the electrodes to your body and connect them to a sleep monitoring device. The electrodes will record different body functions including breathing rate, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and snoring. In the morning, you'll remove the electrodes and return the sleep monitoring device as directed by your provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? The preparations are the same whether you are being tested at a hospital or clinic, or in your home. To prepare for your sleep study: Avoid alcohol and caffeine during the afternoon and evening before your test. Don't nap during the day. Don't use lotions, hair gels, or makeup before the test. They can affect the way the electrodes work. If you normally take sleep medicines, talk to your provider about whether or not you should take the medicine before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? You may have some mild skin irritation from the electrodes. There are no other known risks to having a sleep study.1What do the results mean? Your results may include measurements of the following: Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI). This looks at how many episodes of sleep apnea happen in a night. If you have more than five episodes, it probably means you have sleep apnea. Sleep efficiency. This is a calculation based on the total number of minutes you sleep during the night compared with the amount of time you spend in bed. So if you spend a long time in bed without being able to sleep, you would have low sleep efficiency. Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI). This measures the number of times your oxygen level drops during sleep. Lower than 90 percent oxygen is considered abnormal. Heart rate. A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This result will show if your heart is beating faster or slower than normal. Your provider will review all the results and provide a treatment plan if appropriate. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a sleep study? If you've been diagnosed with sleep apnea, your provider may recommend: Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol, and quitting smoking A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. A CPAP gently blows air into your airways to keep it open while you sleep. Dental devices, such as a:

Mouth guard, which helps prevent you from grinding your teeth during sleep (sleep bruxism). Studies have shown there may a connection between sleep bruxism and sleep apnea.
Mandibular advancement device, a small plastic device that pulls the lower jaw and tongue forward. This helps keep the airways open during sleep.
Tongue-retaining device, which uses suction to keep the tongue forward. If the tongue moves back, it can block your airway.

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-to-expect-in-a-sleep-study-3015121 Smooth Muscle Antibody (SMA) Test : 1What is a smooth muscle antibody (SMA) test? This test looks for smooth muscle antibodies (SMAs) in the blood. A smooth muscle antibody (SMA) is a type of antibody known as an autoantibody. Normally, your immune system makes antibodies to attack foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. An autoantibody attacks the body's own cells and tissues by mistake. SMAs attack smooth muscle tissues in the liver and other parts of the body. If SMAs are found in your blood, it is likely you have autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease in which the immune system attacks liver tissues. There are two types of autoimmune hepatitis: Type 1, the most common form of the disease. Type 1 affects more women than men. It is also more common in people who also have another autoimmune disorder. Type 2, a less common form of the disease. Type 2 mostly affects girls between the ages of 2 and 14. Autoimmune hepatitis can be managed with medicines that suppress the immune system. Treatment is more effective when the disorder is found early. Without treatment, autoimmune hepatitis can cause serious health problems, including cirrhosis and liver failure. Other names: anti-smooth muscle antibody, ASMA, actin antibody, ACTA1What is it used for? An SMA test is primarily used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis. It is also used to find out if the disorder is type 1 or type 2. SMA tests are also often used along with other tests to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. These other tests include: A test for F-actin antibodies. F-actin is a protein found in smooth muscle tissues of the liver and other parts of the body. F-actin antibodies attack these healthy tissues. ANA (antinuclear antibody) test. ANAs are antibodies that attack the nucleus (center) of certain healthy cells. ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) tests. ALT and AST are two enzymes made by the liver.1Why do I need an SMA test? You may need this test if you or your child has symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis. These include: Fatigue Jaundice (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow) Abdominal pain Joint pain Nausea Skin rashes Loss of appetite Dark-colored urine1What happens during an SMA test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for an SMA test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show a high amount of SMA antibodies, it probably means you have the type 1 form of autoimmune hepatitis. A lower amount may mean you have the type 2 form of the disease. If no SMAs were found, it means your liver symptoms are being caused by something different than autoimmune hepatitis. Your health care provider will need to order more tests to make a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about an SMA test? If your results showed that you or your child has SMA antibodies, your provider may order a liver biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue for testing.1References American Liver Foundation. [Internet]. New York: American Liver Foundation; c2017.

A sodium blood test measures the amount of sodium in your blood. Sodium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals. They help control the amount of fluid and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body. Sodium also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. You get most of the sodium you need in your diet. If you take in too much, your kidneys get rid of the extra sodium in your urine. Normally, your body keeps your sodium levels in a very narrow range. If your sodium blood levels are too high or too low, it may mean that you have a kidney problem, dehydration, or another type of medical condition. Other names: Na test1What is it used for? A sodium blood test is a routine test that may be used to check your general health. It may be used to help find and monitor conditions that affect the balance of fluids, electrolytes, and acidity in your body. The test is often done as part of a group of tests called an electrolyte panel. It may also be part of two other groups of tests called a basic metabolic panel (BMP) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)1Why do I need a sodium blood test? Your health care provider may order a sodium blood test as part of your regular checkup or if you take medicine that can affect your fluid balance. You may also have this test if you have symptoms of too much sodium or too little sodium in your blood. 
Symptoms of high sodium levels (hypernatremia) include: Thirst Urinating (peeing) very little Vomiting  Diarrhea Confusion Muscle twitching Seizures Without treatment, extremely high levels of sodium may lead to a coma and become life threatening. Symptoms of low sodium levels (hyponatremia) include: Weakness Fatigue Confusion Muscle twitching Seizures Without treatment, extremely low levels of sodium may lead to a coma and become life threatening.1What happens during a sodium blood test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Your provider will let you know exactly how to prepare for a sodium blood test. On the day of the test, you may need to skip or delay certain medicines. Be sure to tell your provider about any medicines, herbs, or supplements that you take. But don't stop any medicines without talking with your provider first. You may also need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Ask your provider if you have any questions.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Blood sodium levels that are too high or too low can be a sign of many different types of conditions. To make a diagnosis, your provider will usually look at the results of your sodium blood test with the results of other tests, such as measurements of other electrolytes. Sodium blood test results that are higher than normal may be a sign of a condition, such as: Dehydration, which may be caused by not drinking enough, diarrhea, or certain medicines called diuretics (water pills) A disorder of the adrenal glands A kidney disease Diabetes insipidus (uncommon). Sodium blood test results that are lower than normal may be a sign of a condition, such as: A loss of sodium from diarrhea or vomiting A condition that may cause the body to hold onto extra fluid (which dilutes sodium), including:

Kidney diseases
Cirrhosis of the liver
Heart failure
Certain brain and lung diseases
Certain types of cancer
Certain medicines, including many over-the-counter pain relievers and some antidepressants

 Kidney diseases Cirrhosis of the liver Heart failure Certain brain and lung diseases Certain types of cancer Certain medicines, including many over-the-counter pain relievers and some antidepressants Addison disease Malnutrition If your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that need treatment. Certain medicines can increase or decrease your sodium levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I should know about a sodium blood test? Sodium levels are often measured with other electrolytes in another test called the anion gap. An anion gap test looks at the difference between negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes. The test checks for acid imbalances and other conditions.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

A sputum culture is a test that checks for bacteria or another type of organism that may be causing an infection in your lungs or the airways leading to the lungs. Sputum, also known as phlegm, is a thick type of mucus made in your lungs. If you have an infection or chronic illness affecting the lungs or airways, it can make you cough up sputum. Sputum is not the same as spit or saliva. Sputum contains cells from the immune system that help fight the bacteria, fungi, or other foreign substances in your lungs or airways. The thickness of sputum helps trap the foreign material. This allows cilia (tiny hairs) in the airways to push it through the mouth and be coughed out. Sputum can be one of several different colors. The colors can help identify the type of infection you may have or if a chronic illness has become worse: Clear. This usually means no disease is present, but large amounts of clear sputum may be a sign of lung disease. White or gray. This may also be normal, but increased amounts may mean lung disease. Dark yellow or green. This often means a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. Yellowish-green sputum is also common in people with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs. Brown. This often shows up in people who smoke. It is also a common sign of black lung disease. Black lung disease is a serious condition that can happen if you have long-term exposure to coal dust. Pink. This may be a sign of pulmonary edema, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the lungs. Pulmonary edema is common in people with congestive heart failure. Red. This may be an early sign of lung cancer. It may also be a sign of a pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition in which a blood clot from a leg or other part of the body breaks loose and travels to the lungs. If you are coughing up red or bloody sputum, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention. Other names: respiratory culture, bacterial sputum culture, routine sputum culture1What is it used for? A sputum culture is most often used to: Find and diagnose bacteria or fungi that may be causing an infection in the lungs or airways See if a chronic illness of the lungs has worsened See if treatment for an infection is working A sputum culture is often done with another test called a Gram stain. A Gram stain is a test that checks for bacteria at the site of a suspected infection or in body fluids such as blood or urine. It can help identify the specific type of infection you may have.1Why do I need a sputum culture? You may need this test if you have symptoms of pneumonia or another serious infection of the lungs or airways. These include: Cough which produces a lot of sputum Fever Chills Shortness of breath Chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough Fatigue Confusion, especially in older people1What happens during a sputum culture? Your health care provider will need to get a sample of your sputum. During the test: A health care provider will ask you to breathe deeply and then cough deeply into a special cup. Your provider may tap you on the chest to help loosen sputum from your lungs. If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a salty mist that can help you cough more deeply. If you still can't cough up enough sputum, your provider may perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, you'll first get a medicine to help you relax, and then a numbing medicine so you won't feel any pain. Then a thin, lighted tube will be put through your mouth or nose and into the airways. Your provider will collect a sample from your airway using a small brush or suction.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to rinse your mouth out with water before the sample is taken. If you will be getting a bronchoscopy, you may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for one to two hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no risk to providing a sputum sample into a container. If you had a bronchoscopy, your throat may feel sore after the procedure.1What do the results mean? If your results were normal, it means no harmful bacteria or fungi were found. If your results were not normal, it may mean you have some kind of bacterial or fungal infection. Your provider may need to do more tests to find the specific type of infection you have. The most common types of harmful bacteria found in a sputum culture include those that cause: Pneumonia Bronchitis Tuberculosis An abnormal sputum culture result may also mean a flare-up of a chronic condition, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a sputum culture? Sputum may be referred to as phlegm or mucus. All terms are correct, but sputum and phlegm only refer to the mucus made in the respiratory system (lungs and airways). Sputum (phlegm) is a type of mucus. Mucus can also be made elsewhere in the body, such as the urinary or genital tract.1References American Heart Association [Internet]. Dallas (TX): American Heart Association Inc.; c2020.

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-sputum-2249192 STD Tests : 1What are STD tests? STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) are infections that are mostly spread through sexual activity, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Some infections can be spread through close personal contact, such as kissing, or from a mother to her unborn child. STDs are caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Millions of Americans are infected with some type of STD every year, with half of diagnoses occurring in teens and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24. Common STDs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HIV, and HPV (human papillomavirus) infection. Left untreated, certain STDs can cause devastating and long-term health problems such as blindness, brain damage, infertility, birth defects, and even death. Fortunately, all STDs can be treated, and some can be cured entirely. STD testing can help you get diagnosed and treated so you may avoid serious complications. Other names: STD screening, STI (sexually transmitted infections) test, STI screening1What are they used for? STD tests are used to find out if you have been infected with an STD. Testing can help you get the treatment you need and may help prevent the spread of disease.1Why do I need an STD test? STDs don't always cause symptoms, so it is possible to catch or spread an infection even if you or your partner seem healthy. So, you may need an STD screening test if you are at higher risk for infection. Screening is a type of test done for people who don't have symptoms. While all sexually active people could potentially get an STD, testing is mostly recommended for people who fall in one or more of the following risk categories: Sexually active women under the age of 25. Experts recommend that women in this age group get a chlamydia test and a gonorrhea test every year. Sexually active women 25 years and older should be tested if they have new or multiple sex partners or have a partner who has been diagnosed with an STD. Women 21 years and older. Women in this age group should get a Pap smear to check for abnormalities in the cervix. These include precancerous changes which can be caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). Pregnant women. Pregnant women are usually tested for HIV, hepatitis B, chlamydia, and syphilis. Pregnant women with certain risk factors may also be tested for gonorrhea and hepatitis C. Sexually active men and women who have unprotected sex and are not in monogamous relationships. A monogamous relationship means having only one sexual partner at a time. People who have sex without a condom should be tested regularly for HIV and other STDs as recommended by their provider. Men who have sex with men. Compared with other groups, men who have sex with men have a higher risk of STDs. Men in this group should be tested at least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV. Men with multiple partners may benefit from more frequent testing. People with HIV. If you have HIV, you are at higher risk of getting another STD. People in this group should be tested for syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes. A chlamydia test is also usually recommended. People who use injectable drugs. Sharing needles puts you at risk for HIV. Regular HIV testing is recommended for this group. Some STDs do cause symptoms. Symptoms vary depending on the type of STD, but you may need testing if you have one or more of the following symptoms: Painful urination Pain during sex Unusual odor in vaginal discharge Vaginal itching Discharge and/or itching from the penis Sores or bumps in the genital or rectal area1What happens during an STD test? Depending on the type of suspected infection, you may get one of the following types of tests: Blood tests Used to diagnose syphilis, HIV, and sometimes herpes During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial Urine tests Used to diagnose trichomoniasis and sometimes gonorrhea During the test, you will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup as instructed by your provider Swab tests Used to diagnose HPV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and herpes During the test, a provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the site of the infection. In women, samples may be taken from the vagina or cervix. In men, samples may be taken from the penis or urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. Lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap This is not a frequently used STD test, but it may be ordered if your provider thinks you have an advanced stage of syphilis or if a herpes infection has affected your brain or spinal cord. For this test, a provider will inject an anesthetic into your back, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Once the area is numb, the provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small bones that make up your spine. Your provider will then withdraw a small amount of fluid for testing. You may also be able to check for STDs with an at-home test. Home test kits are available for several STDs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and hepatitis C. These tests usually involve using a device (lancet) to prick your finger for a drop of blood, collecting a urine sample, or taking an oral swab. You should discuss your at-home STD test results with your provider to see if you need further testing and/or treatment.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a blood test. If you're a woman, you may need to avoid douches and vaginal creams for 24 hours before a urine or swab test. You may need to empty your bladder before a lumbar puncture. Your provider will let you know if you need to make any other preparations.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to having urine or swab tests. If you had a lumbar puncture, you may have pain or tenderness in your back where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache after the procedure. The headache can last for several hours or up to a week or more.1What do the results mean?  The test result will show whether you have an STD. If you are diagnosed with an STD, there is no need to feel embarrassed or ashamed. STDs affect millions of people. If you have an STD, be sure to take the medicine as prescribed by your provider. It's also very important that you tell your partner, so they can get tested and treated if necessary. 1Is there anything else I need to know about STD tests? The best way to prevent an STD infection is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection by: Being in a long-term relationship with one partner who has tested negative for STDs Using latex condoms correctly every time you have sex. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

This test measures the amount of elastase in your stool. Elastase is an enzyme made by special tissue in the pancreas, an organ in your upper abdomen. Elastase helps break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates after you eat. It's a key part of your digestive process. In a healthy pancreas, elastase will be passed in the stool. If little or no elastase is found in your stool, it can mean this enzyme isn't working as it should. This is called pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency can cause a number of health problems, including malabsorption and malnutrition, disorders that affect your ability to digest and take in nutrients from food. In adults, pancreatic insufficiency is often a sign of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-lasting condition that tends to get worse over time. It can lead to permanent damage of the pancreas. Acute pancreatitis, another form of the disease, is a short-term condition. It is usually diagnosed with blood and/or imaging tests, rather than a stool elastase test. In children, pancreatic insufficiency can be a sign of: Cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease that causes mucus to build up in the lungs, pancreas, and other organs Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, a rare, inherited disease that causes problems with the skeletal system, bone marrow, and pancreas Other names: pancreatic elastase, fecal pancreatic elastase, fecal elastase, FE-11What is it used for? A stool elastase test is used to find out if there is pancreatic insufficiency. This test is better at finding severe pancreatic insufficiency, rather than mild or moderate cases. Pancreatic insufficiency can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer, but this test is not used to screen for or diagnose cancer.1Why do I need a stool elastase test? You may need a stool elastase test if you or your child has symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency. These include: Abdominal pain Smelly, greasy stools Malabsorption, a disorder that affects your ability to digest and absorb nutrients from food. It can cause malnutrition, a condition in which your body does not get the calories, vitamins, and/or minerals needed for good health. Losing weight without trying. In children, this can delay growth and development.1What happens during a stool elastase test? You will need to provide a stool sample. Your provider or your child's provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following: Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves. Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab. You may get a device or applicator to help you collect the sample. Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample. Seal and label the container. Remove the gloves, and wash your hands. Return the container to your health care provider or the lab by mail or in person.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? If you are taking pancreatic enzyme supplements, you may need to stop taking them for five days before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a stool elastase test.1What do the results mean? If your results show a low amount of elastase, it probably means you have pancreatic insufficiency. Your provider will probably order more tests to diagnose the cause of the insufficiency. These tests may include: Blood tests to measure levels of pancreatic enzymes Imaging tests to look at the pancreas and surrounding organs Your child's health care provider may order different types of tests to help diagnose cystic fibrosis or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a stool elastase test? If you are diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, there are treatments that can help manage your condition. Treatment usually includes dietary changes, medicines to manage pain, and/or pancreatic enzyme supplements you can take with each meal. Your provider may also recommend that you give up drinking alcohol and smoking. If your child was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, talk to your child's provider about treatment options.1References CHOC Children's [Internet].

Strep A, also known as group A strep, is a type of bacteria that causes strep throat and other infections. Strep throat is an infection that affects the throat and tonsils. The infection is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. While you can get strep throat at any age, it's most common in children 5 to 15 years old. Strep throat can be easily treated with antibiotics. But left untreated, strep throat can lead to serious complications. These include rheumatic fever, a disease that can damage the heart and joints, and glomerulonephritis, a type of kidney disease. Strep A tests check for strep A infections. There are two types of strep A tests: Rapid strep test. This test looks for antigens to strep A. Antigens are substances that cause an immune response. A rapid strep test can provide results in 10–20 minutes. If a rapid test is negative, but your provider thinks you or your child has strep throat, he or she may order a throat culture. Throat culture. This test looks for strep A bacteria. It provides a more accurate diagnosis than a rapid test, but it can take 24–48 hours to get results. Other names: strep throat test, throat culture, group A streptococcus (GAS) throat culture, rapid strep test, streptococcus pyogenes1What is it used for? A strep A test is most often used to find out if a sore throat and other symptoms are being caused by strep throat or by a viral infection. Strep throat needs to be treated with antibiotics to prevent complications. Most sore throats are caused by viruses. Antibiotics don't work on viral infections. Viral sore throats usually go away on their own.1Why do I need a strep A test? Your health care provider may order a strep A test if you or your child has symptoms of strep throat. These include: A sudden and severe sore throat Pain or difficulty swallowing Fever of 101° or more Swollen lymph nodes Your provider may also order a strep A test if you or your child has a rough, red rash that starts on the face and spreads to another part of the body. This type of rash is a sign of scarlet fever, an illness that can happen a few days after you've been infected with strep A. Like strep throat, scarlet fever is easily treated with antibiotics. If you have symptoms such as a cough or runny nose along with your sore throat, it's more likely that you have a viral infection rather than strep throat.1What happens during a strep A test? A rapid test and a throat culture are done in the same way. During the procedure: You will be asked to tilt your head back and open your mouth as wide as possible. Your health care provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your tongue. He or she will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of your throat and tonsils. The sample may be used to do a rapid strep test in the provider's office. Sometimes the sample is sent to a lab. Your provider may take a second sample and send it to a lab for a throat culture if necessary.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for a rapid strep test or a throat culture.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is no risk to having swab tests, but they may cause slight discomfort and/or gagging.1What do the results mean? If you or your child has a positive result on a rapid strep test, it means you have strep throat or another strep A infection. No further testing will be needed. If the rapid test was negative, but the provider thinks you or your child might have strep throat, he or she may order a throat culture. If you or your child has not already provided a sample, you will get another swab test. If the throat culture was positive, it means you or your child has strep throat or other strep infection. If the throat culture was negative, it means your symptoms are not being caused by strep A bacteria. Your provider will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis. If you or your child was diagnosed with strep throat, you will need to take antibiotics. Most often you will need to take them for 10 days. After a day or two of taking the medicine, you or your child should start to feel better. Most people are no longer contagious after taking antibiotics for 24 hours. But it's important to take all the medicine as prescribed. Stopping early can lead to rheumatic fever or other serious complications. If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a strep A test? Strep A can cause other infections besides strep throat. These infections are less common than strep throat but are often more serious. They include toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating bacteria. There are also other kinds of strep bacteria. These include strep B, which can cause a dangerous infection in newborns, and streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes the most common type of pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumonia bacteria can also cause infections of the ear, sinuses, and bloodstream.1References ACOG: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [Internet].

Strep B, also known as group B strep (GBS), is a type of bacteria commonly found in the digestive tract, urinary tract, and genital area. It rarely causes symptoms or problems in adults but can be deadly to newborns. In women, GBS is mostly found in the vagina and rectum. So a pregnant woman who is infected can pass the bacteria to her baby during labor and delivery. GBS can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and other serious illnesses in a baby. GBS infections are the leading cause of death and disability in newborns. A group B strep test checks for GBS bacteria. If the test shows that a pregnant woman has GBS, she can take antibiotics during labor to protect her baby from infection. Other names: group B streptococcus, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus agalactiae, beta-hemolytic strep culture1What is it used for? A group B strep test is most often used to look for GBS bacteria in pregnant women. Most pregnant women are tested as part of routine prenatal screening. It may also be used to test infants who show signs of infection.1Why do I need a group B strep test? You may need a strep B test if you are pregnant. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends GBS testing for all pregnant women. Testing is usually done in the 36th or 37th week of pregnancy. If you go into labor earlier than 36 weeks, you may be tested at that time. A baby may need a group B strep test if he or she has symptoms of infection. These include: High fever Trouble with feeding Trouble breathing Lack of energy (hard to wake up)1What happens during a group B strep test? If you are pregnant, your health care provider may order a swab test or a urine test. For a swab test, you will lie on your back on an exam table. Your health care provider will use a
small cotton swab to take a sample of cells and fluids from your vagina and rectum. For a urine test, you will most likely be told to use the "clean catch method" to ensure your sample is sterile. It includes the following steps. Wash your hands. Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. To clean, open your labia and wipe from front to back. Start to urinate into the toilet. Move the collection container under your urine stream. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts. Finish urinating into the toilet. Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider. If your baby needs testing, a provider may do a blood test or a spinal tap. For a blood test, a health care professional will use a small needle to take a blood sample from your baby's heel. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. Your baby may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. A spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture, is a test that collects and looks at spinal fluid, the clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. During the procedure: A nurse or other health care provider will hold your baby in a curled-up position. A health care provider will clean your baby's back and inject an anesthetic into the skin, so your baby won't feel pain during the procedure. The provider may put a numbing cream on your baby's back before this injection. The provider may also give your baby a sedative and/or pain reliever to help him or her better tolerate the procedure. Once the area on the back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in the lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up the spine. The provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for group B strep tests.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is no risk to you from a swab or urine test. Your baby may have slight pain or bruising after a blood test, but that should go away quickly. Your baby will likely feel some pain after a spinal tap, but that shouldn't last too long. There is also a small risk of infection or bleeding after a spinal tap.1What do the results mean? If you are pregnant and results show you have GBS bacteria, you will be given antibiotics intravenously (directly to your veins) during labor, at least four hours before delivery. This will prevent you from passing the bacteria to your baby. Taking antibiotics earlier in your pregnancy is not effective, because the bacteria can grow back very quickly. It's also more effective to take antibiotics through your vein, rather than by mouth. You may not need antibiotics if you are having a planned delivery by Cesarean section (C-section). During a C-section, a baby is delivered through the mother's abdomen rather than vaginally. But you still should be tested during pregnancy because you may go into labor before your scheduled C-section. If your baby's results show a GBS infection, he or she will be treated with antibiotics. If your provider suspects a GBS infection, he or she may treat your baby before test results are available. This is because GBS can cause serious illness or death. If you have questions about your results or your baby's results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a group B strep test? Strep B is one type of strep bacteria. Other forms of strep cause different types of infections. These include strep A, which causes strep throat, and streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes the most common type of pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumonia bacteria can also cause infections of the ear, sinuses, and bloodstream.1References ACOG: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [Internet].

Some heart diseases are easier to find when your heart is working its hardest to pump blood through your body. So stress tests check your heart while you exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. If you're not able to exercise, medicine can be used to make your heart work harder , as if you were exercising. There are different types of stress tests. They all check: Blood flow in your heart Your blood pressure The rate and rhythm of your heartbeat The strength of the electrical signals that control your heartbeat Some stress tests also take pictures of your heart at rest and when it's working hard. The pictures provide more detail about how your heart is working. Other names: exercise stress test, treadmill test, stress EKG, stress ECG, exercise tolerance test, exercise EKG, stress echocardiogram, nuclear stress test, thallium stress test, sestamibi stress test, cardiac MRI stress test, myocardial perfusion imaging test, cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), stress perfusion test1What are they used for? Stress tests are most often used to find the cause of symptoms that may be from a heart problem. The tests can help diagnose certain heart conditions, including: Coronary artery disease (CAD)  Angina Arrhythmia Heart failure Heart valve diseases Cardiomyopathy Stress testing is also used: To find out how serious a known heart condition is, including the chance that you'll  have a heart attack in the future. To help make treatment decisions for a heart condition.1Why do I need a stress test? You may need a stress test if you have symptoms that could be from a heart condition. Symptoms may include: Chest pain or discomfort without a known cause Shortness of breath Irregular or rapid heartbeat that may feel like a fluttering in your chest Feeling dizzy or lightheaded You may also need a stress test to check your heart health if you: Have a heart condition with new or worsening symptoms. Are going to have surgery. Your health care provider may want to see if your heart is strong enough for the operation. Are being treated for heart disease. The test can show how much treatment is helping, including heart surgery. Have a high risk for heart disease. Your risk may be higher than normal if you have a family history of heart disease and/or certain conditions, such as diabetes, that are linked to heart disease. Plan to start an exercise program. If you have a heart condition or a high risk for a heart condition, a stress test can show what level of exercise is safe for you. (Always talk with your provider before starting any strenuous, new exercise.)1What happens during a stress test? Stress tests may be done with or without imaging (pictures of your heart). The most common type of test is an exercise stress test. It doesn't include pictures. But the main steps of an exercise stress test are part of all stress tests: 
You'll have a blood pressure cuff on your arm to check your blood pressure.
 You'll have a blood pressure cuff on your arm to check your blood pressure. 
Electrodes will be placed on your body for an electrocardiogram test (also called EKG or ECG). Electrodes are small sensors that stick to your skin. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer or an EKG machine that records the electrical activity in your heart during the stress test.

If you're unable to exercise: An intravenous (IV) line will be inserted into a vein in your arm. You'll get medicine through the IV. The medicine will make your heart work harder for 10 to 20 minutes while an EKG records your heart's electrical activity. Medicine can be used instead of exercise for all types of stress tests.

If you can exercise: You'll walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bicycle. On a treadmill, the speed will slowly increase. The treadmill may also tilt so you feel like you're walking uphill. On a bicycle, the resistance will slowly increase, so it's harder to pedal.

You'll exercise for about 10 to 15 minutes until you reach a target heart rate based on your age and fitness level. But you may stop the test sooner if:


You develop chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue or other symptoms
The EKG shows a problem with your heart

After all types of stress tests, you'll be monitored for 10-15 minutes or until your heart rate returns to normal.
 After all types of stress tests, you'll be monitored for 10-15 minutes or until your heart rate returns to normal. Stress tests with pictures include stress echocardiograms, nuclear stress tests, and cardiac (heart) MRI stress tests. These tests have extra steps: A stress echocardiogram or "echo" takes moving pictures of your heart using doppler ultrasound. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart and blood flow through your heart. Pictures will be taken before and after your heart has worked its hardest. You'll lie on your left side on a table as a provider moves an ultrasound device on your chest. If you exercise on a bicycle, the second set of pictures may be taken while you're pedaling. A nuclear stress test takes pictures of your heart using a small amount of a radioactive substance called a "tracer" and a special camera that scans your heart. A provider injects the tracer into your bloodstream through an IV line that's placed in a vein. Your heart and blood vessels absorb the tracer, which makes them show up more clearly in the pictures. Pictures are taken while you lie on a table before and after your heart has worked its hardest. After the test, the tracer naturally leaves your body in your urine (pee). Drinking lots of water will help remove it faster. A cardiac MRI stress test takes the most detailed pictures of your heart using radio waves, magnets, and a computer. It is a newer test that's mostly used for very serious heart problems. For an MRI stress test: 
A provider may inject dye into your bloodstream through an IV line placed in your arm. Some cardiac MRIs, but not all, use dye to help show very small details on the pictures.

Pictures of your heart may be taken before and after your heart has worked hard. To take the pictures, you'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-like MRI machine. You'll hear loud sounds as the machine takes pictures. If you're exercising for the test, you may use a treadmill near the MRI, or you may exercise while lying in the MRI machine using special devices to move your arms or legs.

If you're exercising for the test, you may use a treadmill near the MRI, or you may exercise while lying in the MRI machine using special devices to move your arms or legs.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Wear comfortable shoes and clothing for exercise. Your provider will tell you what else to do before a stress test. You'll usually need to fast (not eat or drink) and stop smoking for at least a few hours before the test. You may need to avoid drinks with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, and colas, for a longer period of time. If you take medicines or supplements, ask your provider if you should take them as usual. Don't stop taking any medicine unless your provider tells you to. If your test uses MRI, tell your provider about any metal you have in your body. An MRI can heat certain metal and cause burns.1Are there any risks to the test? Stress tests are usually safe. You will be closely watched during the test. If a problem develops, you'll be treated quickly. Medicines that make your heart work harder sometimes cause symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or nausea. An IV may bruise your arm. The tracers and dyes used in nuclear and MRI stress tests may cause an allergic reaction, but this is rare. If you are or could become pregnant or are breastfeeding, talk with your provider before you have these tests.1What do the results mean? A normal test result means no blood flow problems were found. Your heart is working well. If your test result was not normal, it may mean you have heart disease. Ask your provider to explain what condition you may have. You may need more tests to find out how serious your condition is. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1References Advanced Cardiology and Primary Care [Internet]. Advanced Cardiology and Primary Care LLC; c2021.

Every year nearly 800,000 people around the world take their own lives. Many more attempt suicide. In the United States, it's the 10th leading cause of death overall, and the second leading cause of death in people aged 10-34. Suicide has a lasting impact on those left behind and on the community at large. Although suicide is a major health problem, it can often be prevented. A suicide risk screening can help find out how likely it is that someone will try to take their own life. During most screenings, a provider will ask some questions about behavior and feelings. There are specific questions and guidelines that providers can use. These are known as suicide risk assessment tools. If you or a loved one is found to be at risk for suicide, you can get medical, psychological, and emotional support that may help avoid a tragic outcome. Other names: suicide risk assessment1What is it used for? A suicide risk screening is used to find out if someone is at risk for trying to take their own life.1Why do I need a suicide risk screening? You or a loved one may need a suicide risk screening if you notice any of the following warning signs: Feeling hopeless and/or trapped Talking about being a burden to others Increased use of alcohol or drugs Having extreme mood swings Withdrawing from social situations or wanting to be alone A change in eating and/or sleeping habits You may also need a screening if you have certain risk factors. You may be more likely to try to harm yourself if you have: Tried to kill yourself before Depression or other mood disorder A history of suicide in your family A history of trauma or abuse A chronic illness and/or chronic pain A suicide risk screening can be very helpful for people with these warning signs and risk factors. Other warning signs may need to be addressed immediately. These include: Talking about suicide or wanting to die Searching online for ways to kill yourself, getting a gun, or stockpiling medicines such as sleeping pills or pain medicines Talking about having no reason to live If you or a loved one has any of these warning signs, seek help right away. Call 911 or
the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).1What happens during a suicide risk screening? A screening may be done by your primary care provider or a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. Your primary care provider may give you a physical exam and ask you about your use of drugs and alcohol, changes in eating and sleeping habits, and mood swings. These could have many different causes. He or she may ask you about any prescription drugs you are taking. In some cases, antidepressants can increase suicidal thoughts, especially in children, teenagers, and young adults (under the age of 25). You may also get a blood test or other tests to see if a physical disorder is causing your suicidal symptoms. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Your primary care provider or a mental health provider may also use one or more suicide risk assessment tools. A suicide risk assessment tool is type of questionnaire or guideline for providers. These tools help providers evaluate your behavior, feelings, and suicidal thoughts. The most commonly used assessment tools include: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9). This tool is made up of nine questions about suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Ask Suicide-Screening Questions. This includes four questions and is geared toward people aged 10-24. SAFE-T. This is a test that focuses on five areas of suicide risk, as well as suggested treatment options. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This is a suicide risk assessment scale that measures four different areas of suicide risk.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a suicide risk screening? You don't need any special preparations for this screening.1Are there any risks to screening? There is no risk to having a physical exam or a questionnaire. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If the results of your physical exam or blood test show a physical disorder or a problem with a medicine, your provider may provide treatment and change or adjust your medicines as necessary. The results of a suicide risk assessment tool or suicide risk assessment scale can show how likely it is you will attempt suicide. Your treatment will depend on your risk level. If you are at very high risk, you may be admitted to a hospital. If your risk is more moderate, your provider may recommend one or more of the following: Psychological counseling from a mental health professional Medicines, such as antidepressants. But younger people on antidepressants should be closely monitored. The medicines sometimes increase suicide risk in children and young adults. Treatment for addiction to alcohol or drugs Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a suicide risk screening? If you feel you are at risk for taking your own life seek help right away. There are many ways to get help. You can: Call 911 or go to your local emergency room Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). Veterans can call and then press 1 to reach the Veterans Crisis Line. Text the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741). Text the Veterans Crisis Line at 838255. Call your health care or mental health provider Reach out to a loved one or close friend If you are worried that a loved one is at risk for suicide, don't leave them alone. You should also: Encourage them to seek help. Assist them in finding help if needed. Let them know you care. Listen without judgement, and provide encouragement and support. Restrict access to weapons, pills, and other items that could cause harm. You may also want to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) for advice and support.1References American Psychiatric Association [Internet].

Chloride is part of the salt that's found in sweat. The test can diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) because people with CF have higher levels of chloride in their sweat. CF is an inherited disease that can affect people of all ages. To have cystic fibrosis, you must inherit a changed CFTR gene from both your parents. (Changes in genes are also called variants or mutations.) If you inherit one changed gene, you won't have the disease, but you will be a carrier. Being a carrier means that if you have children with someone who also has changes in one or both of their CFTR genes, your children could inherit two changed genes and have CF. The disease affects the parts of your body that make mucus and sweat. Normally, mucus is slippery and protects the linings of your airways, digestive tract, and other organs and tissues. With CF, mucus becomes thick and sticky. It can build-up in your organs and cause damage. CF commonly affects the lungs. Thick mucus may make it hard to breathe and can lead to frequent lung infections and damage. Another common problem from CF is malnutrition because the disease may reduce your body's ability to absorb nutrients from food. Other names: sweat chloride test, cystic fibrosis sweat test, sweat electrolytes1What is it used for? A sweat test is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis.1Why do I need a sweat test? A sweat test can diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) in people of all ages: Babies in the United States have newborn screening tests to check for a variety of conditions, including CF. If a screening test shows that your baby may have CF, a sweat test will be needed to make a diagnosis. It's best if the test is done when your baby is between 10 days and 4 weeks old. Starting treatment as soon as possible can delay or prevent health problems from CF. Children and adults may need a cystic fibrosis sweat test if they have symptoms of CF or if someone in the family has CF. Most people with CF have symptoms, but some people don't. In milder cases, symptoms may not show up until adulthood. The symptoms of CF depend on which organs are affected and may include:


A wheeze or cough that may produce mucus or blood.
Clubbing of fingers and toes, which means that your fingernails and toenails are wide and rounded like the back of a spoon. This is usually due to a low level of oxygen in your blood that happens if your lungs aren't working well. The lack of oxygen may cause changes in your nails.
Fever, which may include night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep).
Digestive symptoms, such as severe abdominal (belly) pain, chronic (long-lasting) diarrhea, or constipation.
Being underweight.
Muscle and joint pain.
Delayed growth or puberty.
Salty skin and saltier than normal sweat.
Sinus infections.

There is no cure for CF, but treatment can help you and/or your child live a longer, healthier life.1What happens during a sweat test? To do a sweat test, a health care professional will collect a sample of sweat from you or your child. This takes about an hour and usually includes the following steps: To cause sweating, an odorless chemical (pilocarpine) will be applied to a small area of the forearm or leg. An electrode will be taped over the area. A weak electrical current will be sent through the electrode to make the chemical seep into the skin. This may cause a little tingling or warmth. After about 5 minutes, the electrode will be removed. The health care professional will collect the sweat by taping a piece of filter paper or gauze on the area or by using a small plastic coil. Sweat will be collected for 30 minutes. The sweat sample will be sent to a lab for testing. Some babies may not produce enough sweat for the test on the first try. If this happens, the test will usually be repeated on another day.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a sweat test, but you should avoid applying any creams or lotions to the skin for 24 hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to a sweat test. The electrode may cause a tingling or tickling sensation from the electric current, but this is not painful.1What do the results mean? Chloride in sweat is measured in mmol/L (millimoles of chloride per liter of sweat): A chloride level of 60 or greater means that you or your child most likely has cystic fibrosis. To confirm the diagnosis, your provider may have you repeat the test or order a CF genetic test. A chloride level of 30 to 59 means that more testing is needed because the test result is unclear, and CF is possible. Your provider may order another sweat test or a different type of test, such as genetic testing. A chloride level less than 29 is normal. This means that you or your child is unlikely to have CF. But a normal test result doesn't rule out CF. Certain people with CF have normal sweat test results. If you or your child have symptoms of CF or if your baby had a newborn screening test that showed possible CF, you will probably need more testing. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a sweat test? In rare cases, conditions other than CF may result in high chloride levels on a sweat test. These conditions include hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and Addison disease.1References American Lung Association [Internet]. Chicago: American Lung Association; c2022.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/kidshealth/en/parents/cf.html/article Synovial Fluid Analysis : 1What is a synovial fluid analysis? Synovial fluid, also known as joint fluid, is a thick liquid located between your joints. The fluid cushions the ends of bones and reduces friction when you move your joints. A synovial fluid analysis is a group of tests that checks for disorders that affect the joints. The tests usually include the following: An exam of physical qualities of the fluid, such as its color and thickness Chemical tests to check for changes in the fluid's chemicals Microscopic analysis to look for crystals, bacteria, and other substances Other names: joint fluid analysis1What is it used for? A synovial fluid analysis is used to help diagnose the cause of joint pain and inflammation. Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. It can cause pain, swelling, redness, and loss of function in the affected area. Causes of joint problems include: Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis. It is a chronic, progressive disease that causes joint cartilage to break down. It can be painful and lead to loss of mobility and function. Gout, a type of arthritis that causes inflammation in one or more joints, usually in the big toe Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition in which the body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your joints Joint effusion, a condition that happens when too much fluid builds up around a joint. It often affects the knee. When it affects the knee, it may be referred to as knee effusion or fluid on the knee. Infection in a joint Bleeding disorder, such as hemophilia. Hemophilia is an inherited disorder that can cause excessive bleeding. Sometimes the excess blood ends up in the synovial fluid.1Why do I need a synovial fluid analysis? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a joint disorder. These include: Joint pain Joint swelling Redness at a joint Joint that feels warm to the touch1What happens during a synovial fluid analysis? Your synovial fluid will be collected in a procedure called arthrocentesis, also known as joint aspiration. During the procedure: A health care provider will clean the skin on and around the affected joint. The provider will inject an anesthetic and/or apply a numbing cream to the skin, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. If your child is getting the procedure, he or she may also be given a sedative. Sedatives are medicines that have a calming effect and help reduce anxiety. Once the needle is in place, your provider will withdraw a sample of synovial fluid and collect it in the syringe of the needle. Your provider will put a small bandage on the spot where the needle was inserted. The procedure usually takes less than two minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? Your joint may be sore for a couple of days after the procedure. Serious complications, such as infection and bleeding may happen, but are uncommon.1What do the results mean? If your results show your synovial fluid was not normal, it may mean one of the following conditions: A type of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout Bleeding disorder Bacterial infection Your specific results will depend on what abnormalities were found. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a synovial fluid analysis? Arthrocentesis, the procedure used to do a synovial fluid analysis, may also be done to remove excess fluid from a joint. Normally, there is only a small amount of synovial fluid between the joints. If you have a joint problem, extra fluid can build up, causing pain, stiffness, and inflammation. This procedure can help relieve pain and other symptoms.1References Arthritis-health [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw231503 Syphilis Tests : 1What are syphilis tests? Syphilis tests are used to screen for and diagnose syphilis. Syphilis is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is a bacterial infection that spreads through vaginal, oral, or anal sexual contact with someone who has the infection. It can also pass from a pregnant person to their baby. Syphilis usually develops in stages. Each stage has different signs and symptoms that can last for weeks, months, or even years. In the beginning, the signs and symptoms may be mild. You may not notice them. So, you could have syphilis and not know it. You could pass the infection to someone else. Syphilis is easiest to cure in the early stages of infection. If it's not treated and develops to a late stage, it can cause permanent damage to your health. Treatment can still help, but it will not reverse the damage. In rare cases, untreated syphilis can even cause death. Syphilis tests can help diagnose the infection in the early stages, when it's easiest to cure. Finding and treating the infection early can also prevent the spread of syphilis to others. Other names: rapid plasma reagin (RPR), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, agglutination assay (TP-PA), darkfield microscopy1What are they used for? Syphilis tests screen for and diagnose syphilis by looking for certain antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes when it finds harmful substances in your body. Syphilis testing usually involves two steps. In most cases, the first step is a screening test to check for antibodies that are linked to having a syphilis infection. But other things may trigger your immune system to make these antibodies, such as autoimmune diseases, other infections, and vaccinations. Screening tests for syphilis usually include: Rapid plasma reagin (RPR), which is a blood test. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, which can be done on blood or spinal fluid If the result of your screening test shows you have antibodies linked to syphilis infections, you'll need a second test to confirm whether or not you have syphilis. Usually, the second test looks for antibodies that your immune system makes only to fight off syphilis. If you have these antibodies, it means you have a syphilis infection now, or you had a syphilis infection that was treated in the past. Common tests to check for syphilis antibodies include: Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test Microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to T. pallidum (MHA-TP) T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) T. pallidum enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA) Chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA) In some cases, a health care provider will use a test that looks for actual syphilis bacteria, instead of antibodies. These tests are used less often because they can only be done in specialized labs.1Why do I need a syphilis test? You should get tested for syphilis if you have symptoms of syphilis or if your sexual partner was recently diagnosed with syphilis. Symptoms usually appear about two to three weeks after infection and include: Small, painless sore (chancre) on the genitals, or in the mouth, anus, or rectum Rough, red rash, usually on the palms of the hands or the bottom of the feet Fever Headache or muscle aches Sore throat Swollen glands Fatigue Weight loss Hair loss in patches Even if you don't have symptoms, you should get tested regularly if you have a high risk for getting syphilis. You're more likely to get syphilis if you have: Multiple sex partners A partner with multiple sex partners Unprotected sex (sex without using a condom) An HIV infection and are sexually active Another sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea Sex with men who have sex with men (MSM) Ask your provider you how often you should get tested. You will also need a syphilis test if you are pregnant. If you pass it to your baby, it could cause serious, and sometimes deadly, health problems in the baby. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all pregnant people have a syphilis test at their first prenatal visit.  Pregnant people who are more likely to become infected with syphilis should be tested again at 28 weeks of pregnancy and at delivery.1What happens during a syphilis test? A syphilis test is usually a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. At any stage, syphilis can affect your brain, spinal cord, and nerves If your symptoms show that syphilis may be affecting your brain and nervous system, your provider may order a syphilis test of your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid found in your brain and spinal cord. To get a sample of the fluid, a provider will do a procedure called a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. During the procedure: You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table. A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection. Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine. Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes. You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn. Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a syphilis blood test. For a lumbar puncture, you may be asked to empty your bladder and bowels before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. If you had a lumbar puncture, you may have pain or tenderness in your back where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache after the procedure. The headache may last from a few hours to more than a week.1What do the results mean? If your screening test results are negative (normal), it means you probably don't have a syphilis infection. But after getting infected, antibodies can take a couple of weeks to develop. So you may need another screening test if you think you were exposed to syphilis. Your provider can tell you whether you need another test. If your screening test results are positive, it means you have antibodies that may be from a syphilis infection. You'll need another test to confirm whether or not you have syphilis. If your follow-up test confirms you have syphilis, you will probably be treated with penicillin, a type of antibiotic. Antibiotic treatment completely cures most early-stage syphilis infections. Later-stage syphilis is also treated with antibiotics, but this treatment can't undo any damage that the syphilis caused. If you have questions about your test results, or about syphilis, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about syphilis tests? If you are diagnosed with syphilis, you need to tell anyone you've had sexual contact with so that they  can get tested and treated if necessary. You will likely need repeat syphilis screening tests to see how well your treatment is working. Avoid sexual contact with others until testing shows you are cured. You may see "self-collection" testing kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases in stores and online. These kits let you collect a sample of your blood at home which you send to a lab for testing. They only test for antibodies to the syphilis bacteria. So you'll still need another test to confirm your diagnosis.  Talk with your provider to find out if a self-collection test is right for you. In certain parts of the world, there are bacteria that are closely related to the bacteria that cause syphilis. These other bacteria usually spread through non-sexual skin contact with sores on a person who has an infection. They can cause diseases called yaws, bejel, and pinta.  Blood tests cannot tell the difference between syphilis and their related bacteria. But a provider can make a diagnosis by looking at skin sores and asking about your medical and travel history.1References American Pregnancy Association [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw5839 Testosterone Levels Test : 1What is a testosterone levels test? A testosterone levels test measures the amount of testosterone in a sample of your blood. Testosterone is known as a "male" sex hormone, but females have testosterone in smaller amounts. Testosterone is made by: The testicles (or testes), the part of the male reproductive system that makes sperm The ovaries, the part of the female reproductive system that makes eggs The adrenal glands, organs on top of each kidney that make several hormones During male puberty, testosterone causes body hair, muscle growth, and a deepening voice. In adult life, it controls sex drive, maintains muscle mass, and helps make sperm. In females, testosterone is important for the growth of bones and muscles, and healthy organs. There are different forms of testosterone in your blood that may be measured to help diagnose certain health problems. Most of your testosterone is attached to proteins. The proteins prevent your tissues from using the testosterone right away, which helps control the amount of "active" testosterone in your body. Testosterone that's not attached to proteins is called free testosterone. Free testosterone acts on your tissues. Three types of blood tests measure these different forms of testosterone: A total testosterone test measures free testosterone and testosterone that's attached to proteins. This is the most common type of test. A free testosterone test measures only the "active" form of testosterone. This test is less common, but it may be useful for diagnosing certain medical conditions. A bioavailable testosterone test measures free testosterone and testosterone that's loosely attached to a blood protein called albumin. This test isn't commonly done. But like a free testosterone test, it may help diagnose certain medical conditions. Other names: serum testosterone, total testosterone, free testosterone, bioavailable testosterone1What is it used for? A testosterone levels test may be used with other tests to help: Diagnose the cause of symptoms that could be from testosterone levels that are too high or too low In children and teens, to find out what's causing:

Early puberty
Delayed puberty

 Early puberty Delayed puberty Testosterone testing is also used to monitor your health if you: Have had an abnormal testosterone test in the past Are taking medicine that may affect your testosterone levels Are a transgender man taking testosterone for masculinizing hormone therapy (also called gender-affirming hormone therapy)1Why do I need a testosterone levels test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of abnormal testosterone levels. For males who have gone through puberty, the test is mostly used for symptoms of low T levels (testosterone levels which are too low). Testosterone levels tend to decrease with age. But other health issues may also cause low T, such as thyroid problems, long-lasting illness, or problems with the testicles. The symptoms of low T may include: Low sex drive Erectile disfunction or "ED" (difficulty getting an erection) Infertility (difficulty getting someone pregnant) Enlarged breasts Lack of face or body hair Thinning bones or anemia without a known cause Loss of muscle mass For females, the test is mostly used for symptoms of high T levels, such as: Abnormal hair growth on the body or face Hair loss on the head that may be like male-pattern baldness (hair loss at the temples and balding on the top of the head) A voice that gets lower Irregular or no menstrual periods Infertility (difficulty getting pregnant) Acne1What happens during a testosterone levels test? A blood sample for a testosterone test should be taken in the morning between 7 and 10. During these hours, your testosterone levels are typically the highest. A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? In certain cases, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Ask your provider how you should prepare for a testosterone levels test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your test results may mean different things depending on which test was done, your age, your symptoms, the results of other tests, and other conditions you may have. So, it's best ask your provider to explain your test results. A testosterone level test alone can't diagnose any health conditions, but abnormal results with symptoms may be a sign of a health problem. In males, low T levels may be caused by different conditions, including:

Chronic (long-lasting) diseases such as liver, or kidney disease
A pituitary gland disorder
Benign tumors (not cancer)
Injury to the testicles
Alcohol use disorder
Certain genetic diseases such as Klinefelter syndrome

 Chronic (long-lasting) diseases such as liver, or kidney disease A pituitary gland disorder Benign tumors (not cancer) Injury to the testicles Alcohol use disorder Certain genetic diseases such as Klinefelter syndrome In females low T levels are normal, but extremely low levels may be a sign of:

An adrenal gland disorder
A pituitary gland disorder
An ovarian disorder

 An adrenal gland disorder A pituitary gland disorder An ovarian disorder In males, high T levels may be caused by:

A tumor in the testicles
Steroid use
An adrenal gland disorder, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)

 A tumor in the testicles Steroid use An adrenal gland disorder, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) In females, high T levels may be caused by:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Ovarian cancer
An adrenal gland disorder, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
A disorder of the pituitary gland

 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Ovarian cancer An adrenal gland disorder, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) A disorder of the pituitary gland If your results are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. It's normal for testosterone levels to decrease with age. And certain medicines can affect your results. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a testosterone levels test? At-home test kits for checking your testosterone levels are available without a prescription. The kits provide everything you need to collect a blood or saliva (spit) sample to send to a lab for testing. Talk with your provider if you think you need to be tested. If you do a home test, share the results with your provider.1References Duca Y, Aversa A, Condorelli RA, Calogero AE, La Vignera S. Substance Abuse and Male Hypogonadism.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is testing that measures the amount of certain medicines in your blood. It is done to make sure the amount of medicine you are taking is both safe and effective. Most medicines can be dosed correctly without special testing. But for certain types of medicines, it can be hard to figure out a dose that provides enough medicine to treat your condition without causing dangerous side effects. TDM helps your provider find out if you are taking the right dose of your medicine. Other names: medicine levels blood test, therapeutic drug levels1What is it used for? Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is used to determine the best dosages for people taking certain types of hard-to-dose medicines. Below are some of the most common medicines that should be monitored.1Why do I need TDM? You may need testing when you first start taking a medicine. This helps your provider figure out the most effective dose for you. Once that dose is determined, you may be tested regularly to make sure the medicine is still effective without being harmful. You may also need testing if you have symptoms of a serious side effect. Side effects vary depending on the medicine. Your health care provider will let you know which symptoms to watch out for.1What happens during TDM? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Depending on the type of medicine you are taking, you may need to schedule your test for before or after you take your regular dose.1Are there any risks to TDM? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will show if medicine levels in your blood are in a range that is medically helpful but not dangerous. This is called the therapeutic range. The range varies depending on the type of medicine and your own health needs. If your results are not in this range, your provider may need to adjust your dosages. If your dosages are changed, you may get repeated tests until your medicine levels fall into the therapeutic range. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References DoveMed [Internet]. DoveMed; c2019.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/abq4055 Thyroglobulin : 1What is a thyroglobulin test? A thyroglobulin test measures the level of thyroglobulin in a sample of your blood. Thyroglobulin is a protein that your thyroid makes. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in your neck. It makes hormones that control many activities in your body, including your heart rate and how fast you burn calories from food. A thyroglobulin test is a type of tumor marker test. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells and/or by normal cells in response to cancer in your body. Normally, your thyroid releases small amounts of thyroglobulin into your bloodstream. Cells from common types of thyroid cancer (papillary carcinoma and follicular thyroid cancer) also release thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin testing is not used to diagnose thyroid cancer because other thyroid diseases that aren't cancer can also affect thyroglobulin levels. But the test is useful after treatment for common thyroid cancers to see if the treatment worked. That's because the goal of treatment is to get rid of all thyroid tissue – both healthy cells and cancer cells. So, if treatment is successful, there should be little or no thyroglobulin in your blood. If thyroglobulin levels remain the same or increase, more cancer treatment may be needed. Other names: Tg, TGB. thyroglobulin tumor marker1What is it used for? A thyroglobulin test is mostly used to: See if thyroid cancer treatment was successful and guide decisions about more treatment. Predict how your cancer will behave over time. See if cancer has returned after successful treatment. Thyroglobulin tests may also be used to help diagnose hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, which are common thyroid conditions that aren't cancer.1Why do I need a thyroglobulin test? You may need a thyroglobulin test before starting treatment for thyroid cancer. Your health care provider will compare these test results to your test results after treatment. You may also need this test a few weeks after you finish treatment for thyroid cancer. The test helps show whether any thyroid cells remain in your body. If your treatment was successful, you may still need to have your thyroglobulin levels tested from time to time to see if cancer has come back.1What happens during a thyroglobulin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for a thyroglobulin test. But you need to avoid taking certain vitamins or supplements so tell your provider about everything you take.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Understanding the results of a thyroglobulin test after treatment can be complicated. The meaning of your results depends on your health history, the type of treatment you had, and the results of other tests. So, it's best to ask your provider to explain what your test results say about your health. In general, if you were tested after treatment for thyroid cancer: Very low levels or no thyroglobulin may mean that your cancer treatment has worked to get rid of all thyroid tissue, including cancer. But you will still need more testing over time to make sure. Thyroglobulin levels that stay high or increase may mean that:

Your treatment did not get rid of all thyroid tissue in your body.
You still have thyroid cancer in your body that has grown and may have spread.

 Your treatment did not get rid of all thyroid tissue in your body. You still have thyroid cancer in your body that has grown and may have spread. Thyroglobulin levels that were low after treatment but later increased  may mean that your thyroid cancer has come back after treatment. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a thyroglobulin test? Labs use different methods to measure the amount of thyroglobulin in your blood sample. The test method can affect your results. So, it's important to have your tests done the same way, and usually in the same lab.  This allows your provider to compare your results over time. If you have questions about this, talk with your provider. A thyroglobulin test may not be useful for monitoring your thyroid cancer treatment if you have thyroglobulin antibodies in your blood. These antibodies are proteins that your immune system may make. They attach to thyroglobulin and can make your thyroglobulin levels appear lower than they really are. Your provider will usually order a thyroid antibody test to find out whether thyroglobulin testing will be useful. If you have thyroglobulin antibodies, other tests will be used to see if your cancer treatment was successful.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Available from: https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/thyroid-disease Thyroid Antibodies : 1What is a thyroid antibodies test? This test measures the level of thyroid antibodies in your blood. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near the throat. Your thyroid makes hormones that regulate the way your body uses energy. It also plays an important role in regulating your weight, body temperature, muscle strength, and even your mood. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. But sometimes antibodies attack the body's own cells, tissues, and organs by mistake. This is known as an autoimmune response. When thyroid antibodies attack healthy thyroid cells, it can lead to an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid. These disorders can cause serious health problems if not treated. There are different types of thyroid antibodies. Some antibodies destroy thyroid tissue. Others cause the thyroid to make too much of certain thyroid hormones. A thyroid antibodies test usually measures one or more of the following types of antibodies: Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO). These antibodies can be a sign of:Hashimoto disease, also known as Hashimoto thyroiditis. This is an autoimmune disease and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid doesn't make enough thyroid hormones.Graves' disease. This is also an autoimmune disease and the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid makes too much of certain thyroid hormones. Hashimoto disease, also known as Hashimoto thyroiditis. This is an autoimmune disease and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid doesn't make enough thyroid hormones. Graves' disease. This is also an autoimmune disease and the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid makes too much of certain thyroid hormones. Thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg). These antibodies can also be a sign of Hashimoto disease. Most people with Hashimoto disease have high levels of both Tg and TPO antibodies. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. These antibodies can be a sign of Grave's disease. Other names: thyroid autoantibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibody, TPO, Anti-TPO, thyroid- stimulating immunoglobulin, TSI1What is it used for? A thyroid antibodies test is used to help diagnose autoimmune disorders of the thyroid.1Why do I need a thyroid antibodies test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a thyroid problem and your provider thinks they may be caused by Hashimoto disease or Grave's disease. Symptoms of Hashimoto disease include: Weight gain Fatigue Hair loss Low tolerance for cold temperatures Irregular menstrual periods Constipation Depression Joint pain Symptoms of Grave's disease include: Weight loss Bulging of the eyes Tremors in the hand Low tolerance for heat Trouble sleeping Anxiety Increased heart rate Swollen thyroid, known as goiter You may also need this test if other thyroid tests show that your thyroid hormone levels are too low or too high. These tests include measurements of hormones known as T3, T4, and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone).1What happens during a thyroid antibodies test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? There are no special preparations necessary for a thyroid antibodies blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results may show one of the following: Negative: no thyroid antibodies were found. This means your thyroid symptoms are probably not caused by an autoimmune disease. Positive: antibodies to TPO and/or Tg were found. This may mean you have Hashimoto disease. Most people with Hashimoto disease have high levels of one or both of these types of antibodies. Positive: antibodies to TPO and/or TSH receptor were found. This may mean you have Grave's disease. The more thyroid antibodies you have, the more likely it is that you have an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid. If you are diagnosed with Hashimoto disease or Grave's disease, there are medicines you can take to manage your condition. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a thyroid antibodies test? Thyroid disease can get worse during pregnancy. This can harm both the mother and her unborn baby. If you have ever had thyroid disease and are pregnant, you may be tested for thyroid antibodies along with tests that measure thyroid hormones. Medicines to treat thyroid disease are safe to take during pregnancy.1References American Thyroid Association [Internet]. Falls Church (VA): American Thyroid Association; c2019.

A thyroxine test is a blood test that helps diagnose thyroid conditions. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your throat. Your thyroid makes hormones that control the way your body uses energy. These hormones affect your weight, heart, body temperature, muscle strength, and even your mood. In children, thyroid hormones affect growth, too. Thyroxine, also known as T4, is a type of thyroid hormone. A T4 test measures the level of T4 in your blood. Too much or too little T4 can be a sign of thyroid disease. There are two forms of T4 in your blood: Free T4 is the active form of thyroxine hormone that enters your tissues where it's needed. Bound T4 is thyroxine that attaches or binds to certain proteins which prevent it from entering your tissues. T4 levels can be measured with either a free T4 test or a total T4 test: A free T4 test directly measures the amount of free T4 in your blood. Medical experts believe this test provides more accurate information than a total T4 test, so it's used more often. A total T4 test measures free and bound T4 together. A calculation may be done to figure out how much T4 is free. This is a less accurate way to check how well your thyroid is working. Other names: free thyroxine, free T4, total T4 concentration, T4 index, thyroxine screen, free T4 concentration, thyroxine test by equilibrium dialysis1What is it used for? A T4 test is used to check how well your thyroid is working. It's also used to help diagnose and monitor thyroid disease and conditions that may affect your thyroid, including: Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, which is when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone to meet your body's needs Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, which is when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than your body needs Disorders of the pituitary gland, which is a gland at the base of your brain that makes TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). TSH controls how much T4 your thyroid gland makes. If the results from a TSH test aren't normal, a T4 test can help diagnose whether the problem is with your thyroid or your pituitary gland. In certain cases, a T4 test may be done as part of a group of tests called a thyroid panel. A thyroid panel includes a test for TSH as well as other thyroid tests.1Why do I need a thyroxine test? You may need a T4 test if your provider thinks you may have a thyroid problem. Usually, a TSH test is done first.  If your TSH results aren't normal, a T4 test may be done to learn more. Thyroid problems tend to run in families, so your provider may order a T4 test if a member of your family has had thyroid disease. You may also need a T4 test if you have symptoms of having too much or too little thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone), may include: Weight gain Fatigue Dry skin Dry, thinning hair Being very sensitive to cold temperatures Heavy or irregular menstrual periods or fertility problems Slow heart rate Depression Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) may include: Anxiety, nervousness, irritability Weight loss, even though your appetite may increase Shaky hands, muscle weakness Sweating or being very sensitive to heat Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Frequent bowel movements (poops) Goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland) Trouble sleeping and fatigue1What happens during a thyroxine test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? In most cases, you don't need any special preparations for a thyroxine blood test. Certain medicines and supplements may affect your test results, so let your provider know what you're taking, but don't stop any medicines without talking with your provider. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If you had a free T4 test, your test results may be reported as "free T4." If you had a total T4 test, your results may be reported as "free T4 index (FTI)."  To fully understand your results, your provider will often need to compare them with the results of other thyroid tests. In general, T4 results that are lower than normal may be a sign of: Hypothyroidism, which may be caused by Hashimoto disease or another medical condition that causes your thyroid to make too little T4 Thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) Side effects from certain drugs Congenital hypothyroidism (a condition that affects babies from birth) In general, T4 results that are higher than normal may be a sign of: Hyperthyroidism, which may be caused by Graves disease or another medical condition that causes your thyroid to make too much T4 Thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) Toxic goiter (an enlarged thyroid with areas that make extra thyroid hormone) Toxic thyroid nodule (a single lump on the thyroid that makes extra thyroid hormone) Too much iodine in your diet A noncancerous (not cancer) tumor in your pituitary gland Talk with your provider about what your results mean. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a thyroxine test? Thyroid disease can develop during pregnancy, but it's not common. Hyperthyroidism, and less often, hypothyroidism, may remain after pregnancy. If you develop a thyroid condition during pregnancy, your provider will monitor your condition after your baby is born. Also, if you have a history of thyroid disease, be sure to talk with your provider if you are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant. Newborn babies usually have a T4 test to screen for congenital hypothyroidism.1References American Thyroid Association [Internet]. Falls Church (VA): American Thyroid Association; c2022.

A total protein and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio test measures the total amount of protein in your blood. There are two major types of protein in the blood: Albumin, which helps keep blood from leaking out of blood vessels. It also helps move hormones, medicines, vitamins, and other important substances throughout the body. Albumin is made in the liver. Globulins, which help fight infection and move nutrients throughout the body. Some globulins are made by the liver. Others are made by the immune system. The test also compares the amount of albumin in your blood to the amount of globulin. The comparison is called the albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio. If your total protein levels or A/G ratio results are not normal, it can be a sign of a serious health problem. Other names: total serum protein, TP albumin/globulin ratio1What is it used for? A total protein and A/G ratio test is often included as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel, a test that measures proteins and other substances in the blood. It may also be used to help diagnose kidney disease, liver disease, or nutritional problems.1Why do I need a total protein and A/G ratio test? You may get this test as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel, which is often included in a routine checkup. You may also need this test if you have symptoms that indicate abnormal protein levels. These include: Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, and/or abdomen, which is caused by extra fluid in your tissues Fatigue Unexplained weight loss Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). This is a common symptom of liver disease. Blood in the urine, a common symptom of kidney disease1What happens during a total protein and A/G ratio test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test? You don't need any special preparations for a total protein and A/G ratio test.1Are there any risks to this test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your results will show whether you have normal, low, or high total protein levels. They will also show if you have a normal, low, or high albumin to globulin (A/G) ratio. If your total protein levels were low, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: Liver disease Kidney disease Malnutrition, a condition in which your body does not get the calories, vitamins, and/or minerals needed for good health A malabsorption syndrome, a type of disorder in which your small intestine can't absorb enough nutrients from food. Malabsorption syndromes include celiac disease and Crohn's disease. If your total protein levels were high, it may mean you have one of the following conditions: An infection such as HIV or viral hepatitis Multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer If your A/G ratio was low, it may be caused by: An autoimmune disease, such as lupus Liver disease, including cirrhosis Kidney disease If your A/G ratio was high, it may be caused by: Certain types of genetic disorders Leukemia If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a total protein and A/G ratio test? In addition to total protein levels, your provider may order a separate blood test for albumin and/or a test for globulins. The globulins test is called serum electrophoresis. It is a blood test that measures the levels of four different types of globulins. These results may show the following: Low albumin levels may be a sign of: Liver disease, including cirrhosis Kidney disease Malnutrition Thyroid disease High albumin levels may be a sign of: Severe dehydration Diarrhea Low globulin levels may be a sign of: Liver disease Kidney disease High globulin levels may be a sign of: Certain types of blood cancers, such as multiple myeloma, Hodgkin disease, or leukemia Hemolytic anemia An autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Tuberculosis1References American Liver Foundation.

Available from: https://www.verywellhealth.com/globulin-test-uses-side-effects-procedure-results-4767946 TP53 Genetic Test : 1What is a TP53 genetic test? A TP53 genetic test looks for a change, known as a mutation, in a gene called TP53 (tumor protein 53). Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father. TP53 is a gene that helps stop the growth of tumors. It's known as a tumor suppressor. A tumor suppressor gene works like the brakes on a car. It puts the "brakes" on cells, so they don't divide too quickly. If you have a TP53 mutation, the gene may not be able to control the growth of your cells. Uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer. A TP53 mutation can be inherited from your parents, or acquired later in life from the environment or from a mistake that happens in your body during cell division. An inherited TP53 mutation is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare genetic condition that can increase your risk of certain types of cancers. These cancers include breast cancer, bone cancer, leukemia, and soft tissue cancers, also called sarcomas. Acquired (also known as somatic) TP53 mutations are much more common. These mutations have been found in about half of all cases of cancer, and in many different types of cancer. Other names: TP53 mutation analysis, TP53 full gene analysis, TP53 somatic mutation1What is it used for? The test is used to look for a TP53 mutation. It is not a routine test. It is usually given to people based on family history, symptoms, or previous diagnosis of cancer.1Why do I need a TP53 genetic test? You may need a TP53 test if: You've been diagnosed with a bone or soft tissue cancer before the age of 45 You've been diagnosed with, pre-menopausal breast cancer, a brain tumor, leukemia, or lung cancer before the age of 46 You've had one or more tumors before the age of 46 One or more of your family members have been diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and/or have had cancer before the age of 45 These are signs you may have an inherited mutation of the TP53 gene. If you've been diagnosed with cancer and don't have a family history of the disease, your health care provider may order this test to see if a TP53 mutation may be causing your cancer. Knowing whether you have the mutation can help your provider plan treatment and predict the likely outcome of your disease.1What happens during a TP53 genetic test? A TP53 test is usually done on blood or bone marrow. If you are getting a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. If you are getting a bone marrow test, your procedure may include the following steps: You'll lie down on your side or your stomach, depending on which bone will be used for testing. Most bone marrow tests are taken from the hip bone. Your body will be covered with cloth, so that only the area around the testing site is showing. The site will be cleaned with an antiseptic. You will get an injection of a numbing solution. It may sting. Once the area is numb, the health care provider will take the sample. You will need to lie very still during the tests. The health care provider will use a special tool that twists into the bone to take out a sample of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure on the site while the sample is being taken. After the test, the health care provider will cover the site with a bandage. Plan to have someone drive you home, since you may be given a sedative before the tests, which may make you drowsy.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You usually don't need any special preparations for a blood or bone marrow test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After a bone marrow test, you may feel stiff or sore at the injection site. This usually goes away in a few days. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe a pain reliever to help.1What do the results mean? If you've been diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, it does not mean you have cancer, but your risk is higher than most people. But if you have the mutation, you can take steps to reduce your risk, such as: More frequent cancer screenings. Cancer is more treatable when found in the early stages. Making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise and eating a healthier diet Chemoprevention, the taking of certain medicines, vitamins, or other substances to reduce the risk or delay the development of cancer. Removing "at-risk" tissue These steps will vary depending on your health history and family background. If you have cancer and your results indicate an acquired TP53 mutation (a mutation was found, but you have no family history of cancer or Li-Fraumeni syndrome), your provider can use the information to help predict how your disease will develop and guide your treatment. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a TP53 test? If you've been diagnosed with or suspect you have Li-Fraumeni syndrome, it may help to speak to a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. If you haven't yet been tested, the counselor can help you understand the risks and benefits of testing. If you have been tested, the counselor can help you understand the results and direct you to support services and other resources.1References American Cancer Society [Internet].

Trichomoniasis, often called trich, is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a parasite. A parasite is a tiny plant or animal that gets nutrients by living off another creature. Trichomoniasis parasites are spread when an infected person has sex with an uninfected person. The infection is more common in women, but men can also get it. Infections usually affect the lower genital tract. In women, that includes the vulva, vagina, and cervix. In men, it most often infects the urethra, a tube that carries urine out of the body. Trichomoniasis is one of the most common STDs. In the United States, it's estimated that more than 3 million people are currently infected. Many people with the infection don't know they have it. This test can find the parasites in your body, even if you don't have symptoms. Trichomoniasis infections are rarely serious, but they can increase your risk of getting or spreading other STDs. Once diagnosed, trichomoniasis is easily cured with medicine. Other names: T. vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis testing, wet prep1What is it used for? The test is used to find out if you have been infected with the trichomoniasis parasite. A trichomoniasis infection can put you at higher risk for different STDs. So this test is often used along with other STD testing.1Why do I need a trichomoniasis test? Many people with trichomoniasis don't have any signs or symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they usually show up within 5 to 28 days of infection. Both men and women should get tested if they have symptoms of an infection. Symptoms in women include: Vaginal discharge that is gray-green or yellow. It is often foamy and may have a fishy smell. Vaginal itching and/or irritation Painful urination Discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse Men usually don't have symptoms of infection. When they do, symptoms may include: Abnormal discharge from the penis Itching or irritation on the penis Burning feeling after urination and/or after sex STD testing, including a trichomoniasis test, may be recommended if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk for trichomoniasis and other STDs if you have: Sex without using a condom Multiple sex partners A history of other STDs1What happens during a trichomoniasis test? If you are a woman, your health care provider will do a visual exam of your genitals to look for patchy red spots. Those can be a sign of trichomoniasis. Your provider will also take a sample of discharge and/or cells from your vagina using a small brush or swab. The sample will be placed on a special slide. A laboratory professional will examine the slide under a microscope and look for parasites. If you're a man, your health care provider will do a visual exam of your penis and may use a swab to take a sample from your urethra. You will also probably get a urine test. Both men and women may get a urine test. During a urine test, you will be instructed to provide a clean catch sample: The clean catch method generally includes the following steps: Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back. Start to urinate into the toilet. Move the collection container under your urine stream. Pass at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts. Finish urinating into the toilet. Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a trichomoniasis test.1Are there any risks to the test? There are no known risks to having a trichomoniasis test.1What do the results mean? If your result was positive, it means you have a trichomoniasis infection. Your provider will prescribe medicine that will treat and cure the infection. Your sexual partner should also be tested and treated. If your test was negative but you still have symptoms, your provider may order another trichomoniasis test and/or other STD tests to help make a diagnosis. If you are diagnosed with the infection, be sure to take the medicine as prescribed. Without treatment, the infection can last for months or even years. The medicine can cause side effects such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It's also very important to not drink alcohol while on this medicine. Doing so can cause more severe side effects. If you are pregnant and have a trichomoniasis infection, you may be at higher risk for premature delivery and other pregnancy problems. But you should talk to your health care provider about the risks and benefits of medicines that treat trichomoniasis. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a trichomoniasis test? The best way to prevent infection with trichomoniasis or other STDs is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection by: Being in a long-term relationship with one partner who has tested negative for STDs Using condoms correctly every time you have sex1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

This test checks for the amount or the presence of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) in blood or urine. TCAs are a type of antidepressant. Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression, a serious illness that can affect how you think, feel, and behave. There are several types of antidepressants. They each work in slightly different ways. TCAs were one of the first types of antidepressants developed. They can be effective, but they tend to cause more side effects than newer types of antidepressants. But since it's common for antidepressants to become less effective or ineffective over time, TCAs can be a good option to treat depression when other antidepressants have failed. Commonly prescribed TCAs include: Doxepin Nortriptyline Amitriptyline Imipramine Desipramine TCAs have to be carefully dosed. It can be hard to find a dose that is effective without being dangerous. In fact, TCAs are the cause of many prescription drug overdose deaths in the United States. Other names: TCA test, TCA screen1What is it used for? A TCA screen is used to: Help your health care provider prescribe the right dose of a TCA Find out if you are misusing TCA  (taking it without a prescription or taking more than the prescribed dose). The test may be included as part of a drug (toxicology) screen, a test that checks for the presence of several different prescription and illegal drugs. Diagnose a TCA overdose. Prompt treatment of an overdose can be lifesaving.1Why do I need a TCA screen? You may need this test if you have been prescribed a TCA to make sure you are getting a dose that is safe and effective. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of a TCA overdose. These include:  Dry mouth Blurred vision Constipation Trouble urinating Drowsiness Lightheadedness Seizures1What happens during a TCA screen? A TCA screen can be done as a blood test or a urine test. During a TCA blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a TCA urine test, you will need to provide a sample of urine into a sterile cup. Your provider will give more information on how to collect your sample.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a TCA screen.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a urine test.1What do the results mean? Your blood test results will show the levels of TCA in your bloodstream. Depending on the levels and on which TCA you are taking, your provider may adjust your dosage. There are two types of urine test results. One type will show whether TCA was found, but not how much. The other type shows the levels of TCA. If blood or urine test results show you have dangerously high levels of TCA, you will be treated immediately. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a TCA screen? TCAs are most often prescribed by a mental health professional, a specialist in diagnosing and treating mental health problems, such as depression. There are many types of mental health professionals. Some types, usually medical doctors, are allowed to prescribe medicines including TCAs. Other mental health professionals work with providers who are able to write prescriptions. The most common types of mental health professionals include: Psychiatrist, a medical doctor who specializes in mental health. Psychiatrists diagnose and treat mental health disorders. They can prescribe medicine. Psychologist, a professional trained in psychology. Psychologists generally have doctoral degrees, such as a Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) or a Psy.D. (Doctor of Psychology). But they do not have medical degrees. Psychologists diagnose and treat mental health disorders. They may offer one-on-one counseling and/or group therapy sessions. They can prescribe medicine if they have a special license. If not, they may work with providers who are able to. Licensed clinical social worker (L.C.S.W.) has a master's degree in social work with training in mental health. Some have additional degrees and training. L.C.S.W.s diagnose and provide counseling for a variety of mental health problems. They can't prescribe medicine but can work with providers who are able to. Licensed professional counselor (L.P.C.). Most L.P.C.s have a master's degree. But training requirements vary by state. L.P.C.s diagnose and provide counseling for a variety of mental health problems. They can't prescribe medicine but can work with providers who are able to. L.C.S.W.s and L.P.C.s may be known by other names, including therapist, clinician, or counselor. Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are specially trained nurses who have a master’s or doctoral degree in psychiatric nursing. They assess, diagnose, and treat a variety of mental health disorders. Some ARPNs can prescribe medicines. If you have depression, it's important to get treatment. If you don't know which type of mental health provider you should see, talk to your primary care provider.1References American Psychiatric Nurses Association [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/pl1023 Triglycerides Test : 1What is a Triglycerides Test? A triglycerides test is a blood test that measures the amount of a fat in your blood called triglycerides. High triglycerides may increase your risk for a heart attack or stroke. A triglycerides test can help you decide if you need to take action to lower your risk. Your body uses triglycerides for energy. If you eat more calories than you need, your body turns the extra calories into triglycerides and stores them in your fat cells to use later. When your body needs energy, your cells release triglycerides into your bloodstream to provide fuel for your muscles to work. If you eat more calories than you burn off, especially calories from carbohydrates, including sugary foods, and fats, you may have high triglyceride levels in your blood. A high blood triglyceride level usually doesn't cause any symptoms, but over time, it may affect your arteries and increase your risk of heart disease. Extremely high levels of triglycerides also increase the risk of acute pancreatitis in adults and children. Other names for a triglycerides test: TG, TRIG, lipid panel, fasting lipoprotein panel1What is it used for? A triglycerides test is used to understand your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other conditions that involve your arteries, such as peripheral arterial disease. The test is also used to help monitor heart conditions and treatments to lower the risk of heart disease. A triglycerides test is usually done as part of a group of tests called a lipid profile. Lipid is another word for fat. A lipid profile measures the level of fats in your blood, including triglycerides and cholesterol. If you have high levels of both LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides, you may have a higher risk for a heart attack or stroke.1Why do I need a triglycerides test? Your health care provider may order a lipid profile, including a triglycerides test, as part of a regular checkup. If you are being treated for high cholesterol and/or triglycerides, you may also need this test to see how well your treatment is working. How often you need to have a lipid profile test depends on your age, sex, and your risk of developing heart disease. The general age recommendations for testing blood lipid levels are: For ages 2 to 19: In general, start testing between ages nine and 11. Repeat the test every five years. If there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, stroke, or other risks for developing heart disease, test as early as age two. For ages 20 and older, tests should be done: Every five years for:

Males between ages 20 and 45
Females between ages 20 and 55

 Males between ages 20 and 45 Females between ages 20 and 55 Every 1 to 2 years for:

Males age 45 and older
Females age 55 and older

 Males age 45 and older Females age 55 and older Every year for adults over age 65 You may need to be tested more often if you have a higher risk for heart disease because you: Have a family health history of early heart disease (a parent or sibling with heart disease before age 55 for males, and before age 65 for females) Smoke Are overweight or have obesity Have unhealthy eating habits Don't get enough exercise Have diabetes Have high blood pressure Are a male age 45 or older, or a female age 50 or older Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood lipid levels tested.1What happens during a triglycerides test? During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 9 to 12 hours before your blood is drawn. Your provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Triglycerides are usually measured in milligrams (mg) of triglycerides per deciliter (dL) of blood.  Guidelines for normal and higher levels of triglycerides are used to help decide when treatment is needed. The commonly used guidelines for adults are: Guidelines for children and teens are different than adults. Ask your child's provider to explain what your child's test results mean. Triglyceride levels that are higher than normal may mean you have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and other conditions that affect your arteries. To reduce your blood triglycerides, your health care provider may first recommend lifestyle changes, such as: Eating heart-healthy foods and limiting added sugar and foods high in saturated fat Getting regular physical activity Limiting alcohol Quitting smoking Aiming for a healthy weight Getting enough sleep Managing stress In certain cases, you may also need medicine to help lower your triglyceride levels. Before making any major changes to your diet or exercise routine, talk with your provider about what treatment is best for you. Triglyceride levels that are too low are very uncommon. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about triglyceride tests? Certain commonly used medicines can increase blood triglyceride levels, so ask your provider if any medicines you take could affect your test results. Certain medical conditions can also increase blood triglycerides, including: Kidney failure Liver disease Thyroid disease Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Diabetes Obesity If one of these conditions could be increasing your triglycerides, it's important to treat the condition to help lower your blood triglycerides and your risk of heart disease and stroke.1References American Heart Association [Internet].

This test measures the level of triiodothyronine (T3) in your blood. T3 is one of two major hormones made by your thyroid, a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near the throat. The other hormone is called thyroxine (T4.) T3 and T4 work together to regulate how your body uses energy. These hormones also play an important role in controlling your weight, body temperature, muscle strength, and nervous system. The T3 hormone comes in two forms: Bound T3, which attaches to protein Free T3, which does not attach to anything A test that measures both bound and free T3 is called a total T3 test. Another test called free T3 just measures free T3. Either test may be used to check T3 levels. If T3 levels are not normal, it can be a sign of thyroid disease.
 Other names: thyroid function test; total triiodothyronine, free triiodothyronine, FT31What is it used for? A T3 test is most often used to diagnose hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the body makes too much thyroid hormone. T3 tests are frequently ordered with T4 and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) tests. A T3 test may also be used to monitor treatment for thyroid disease.1Why do I need a T3 test? You may need a T3 test if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism. These include: Anxiety Weight loss Tremors in the hands Increased heart rate Bulging of the eyes Trouble sleeping Fatigue Low tolerance for heat More frequent bowel movements1What happens during a T3 test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a T3 blood test. Your health care provider will let you know if you need to stop taking any medicines before your test. Certain medicines can raise or lower T3 levels.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? If your results show high total T3 levels or high free T3 levels, it may mean you have hyperthyroidism. Low T3 levels may mean you have hypothyroidism, a condition in which your body doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. T3 test results are often compared with T4 and TSH test results to help diagnose thyroid disease. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a T3 test? Thyroid changes can happen during pregnancy. These changes are usually not serious, and most pregnant women don't need T3 testing. But your health care provider may order a T3 test during pregnancy if you have: Symptoms of thyroid disease A history of thyroid disease An autoimmune disease A family history of thyroid disease1References AACE  [Internet].

Available from: https://ufhealth.org/t3-test Troponin Test : 1What is a troponin test? A troponin test measures the level of troponin in your blood. Troponin is a type of protein found in the muscles of your heart. Troponin isn't normally found in the blood. When heart muscles become damaged, troponin is sent into the bloodstream. As heart damage increases, greater amounts of troponin are released in the blood. High levels of troponin in the blood may mean you are having or recently had a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart gets blocked. This blockage can be deadly. But quick diagnosis and treatment can save your life. Other names: cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), cardiac troponin (cTN),
cardiac-specific troponin I and troponin T1What is it used for? This test is most often used to diagnose a heart attack. It is sometimes used to monitor angina, a condition that limits blood flow to the heart and causes chest pain. Angina sometimes leads to a heart attack. This test may also be used after you were diagnosed with a heart attack and admitted to a hospital. Testing is usually repeated two or more times in a 24-hour period. This is done to see if there are any changes in troponin levels over time. 1Why do I need a troponin test? You may need this test if you have been admitted to the emergency room with symptoms of a heart attack. These symptoms include: Chest pain or discomfort Pain in other parts of the body, including your arm, back, jaw, or neck Trouble breathing Nausea and vomiting Fatigue Dizziness Sweating If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 immediately.1What happens during a troponin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a troponin test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean?  If your results show normal troponin levels for 12 hours after chest pain has started, it's unlikely that your symptoms were caused by a heart attack. If even a small level of troponin is found in your blood, it may mean there is some damage to your heart. If high levels of troponin are found in one or more tests over time, it probably means you had a heart attack. Other reasons for higher than normal troponin levels include: Congestive heart failure Kidney disease Blood clot in your lungs If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a troponin test? New studies show that a new type of troponin blood test may be able to identify people who are at greater risk for heart attacks before they even have symptoms. The test is able to detect very small amounts of troponin.1References American Heart Association [Internet]. Dallas (TX): American Heart Association Inc.; c2020.

TSH stands for thyroid stimulating hormone. A TSH test is a blood test that measures this hormone. TSH levels that are too high or too low may be a sign of a thyroid problem. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. Your thyroid makes hormones that control how your body uses energy. Thyroid hormones affect nearly every organ in your body, including your heart. They help control your weight, body temperature, muscle strength, and even your mood. If you don't have enough thyroid hormones in your blood, many of your body functions slow down. If you have too much, many body functions speed up. Your thyroid is controlled by a gland in your brain, called the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland makes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH tells your thyroid how much thyroid hormone it needs to make. If the thyroid hormone levels in your blood are too low, your pituitary gland makes larger amounts of TSH to tell your thyroid to work harder. If your thyroid hormone levels are too high, the pituitary gland makes little or no TSH. By measuring TSH levels in your blood, you can find out if your thyroid is making the right level of hormones. Other names: thyrotropin test1What is it used for? A TSH test is used to find out how well your thyroid is working. It can tell if you have hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) or hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone) in your blood. But a TSH test can't show what is causing a thyroid problem. If you take prescription thyroid hormone medicine because of hypothyroidism or because you had your thyroid removed, you'll have regular TSH tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. TSH tests are also used to monitor your thyroid hormone levels after treatment for hyperthyroidism.1Why do I need a TSH test? You may need a TSH test if you have symptoms of too much or too little thyroid hormone in your blood. Hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) is also called overactive thyroid. Having more thyroid hormones than you need speeds up your body functions and causes symptoms that include: Weight loss, even though you may be eating more than usual Rapid or irregular heartbeat Feeling nervous or irritable Trouble sleeping, fatigue Shaky hands, muscle weakness Sweating or being very sensitive to heat Frequent bowel movements (pooping a lot) Goiter (enlarged thyroid) Hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone) is also called underactive thyroid. Not having enough thyroid hormone slows down your body functions and causes symptoms that include: Fatigue Weight gain Being very sensitive to cold Joint and muscle pain Dry skin Dry, thinning hair Heavy or irregular menstrual periods Depression Constipation You may also have a TSH test, along with other tests, to help diagnose unusual bumps or lumps on your thyroid that may be thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules (growths on your thyroid that aren't cancer).1What happens during a TSH test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a TSH blood test. If your health care provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your TSH test results can tell you if your thyroid is making too much or too little thyroid. But the test can't explain why your TSH levels may be too high or too low. If your test results aren't normal, your provider will probably order other thyroid blood tests to find out what's causing your thyroid problem. These blood tests may include: T4 thyroid hormone test T3 thyroid hormone test Thyroid antibodies test to help diagnose an autoimmune thyroid disorder, such as:

Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism
Hashimoto's disease, that the most common cause of hypothyroidism

 Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism Hashimoto's disease, that the most common cause of hypothyroidism In certain cases, an abnormal TSH result may be a sign of a pituitary gland problem, but this doesn't happen often. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a TSH test? TSH levels may be high or low even when your thyroid gland is healthy. Serious illnesses not related to your thyroid may cause lower TSH levels for a short time. And TSH levels may be higher in people over age 80, even though they don't have any thyroid problems. Pregnancy also affects TSH levels. They are often a little low during the first three months. But sometimes, thyroid disease develops during pregnancy. If you develop thyroid disease during pregnancy, your provider will monitor your condition through your pregnancy and after your baby is born. That's because hyperthyroidism, and less often, hypothyroidism, can continue after you give birth. If you have a history of thyroid disease, be sure to talk with your provider if you are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant. Newborn babies are routinely screened with a TSH test to see if they were born with hypothyroidism (congenital hypothyroidism).1References American Thyroid Association [Internet].

A tuberculosis screening test checks to see if you have the bacteria (germs) that cause tuberculosis (TB) in your body. TB is a bacterial infection that mainly attacks the lungs. But it can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain, spine, and kidneys. TB spreads from person to person when a someone who is sick with TB coughs or sneezes. TB germs cause two types of conditions: Latent TB infection happens when you have TB germs in your body, but you're not sick because the germs aren't active. You don't have symptoms and you can't spread the disease to others. But the germs could start to grow (multiply) and make you sick in the future. So, latent TB infection is usually treated to prevent you from getting sick with active TB. Active TB disease means that TB germs are actively growing in your body and making you sick. If TB germs grow in your lungs or throat, you can spread the disease to other people. TB disease can almost always be cured with antibiotics. But without treatment, it can cause serious illness or even death. A TB screening test checks to see if you have TB germs in your body. But it can't show whether you have a latent TB infection or active TB disease. If a TB screening test finds signs of TB germs, you'll need other tests to find out which type of TB you have so you can get the right treatment. There are two types of TB tests used for screening: a TB skin test and a TB blood test. Your health care provider or your local health department can let you know which test is best for you. Other names: TB test, TB skin test, purified protein derivative (PPD) test, latent TB infection test, Mantoux tuberculin skin test; IGRA test, TB blood test1What is it used for? TB screening is used to look for signs of TB germs in people who have been exposed to someone with active TB disease or who have a high risk of exposure. The screening can show whether you have TB germs in your body and need more testing. It does not show if you have a latent infection or active disease.1Why do I need a TB screening? You may need a TB skin test or TB blood test if you were exposed to someone with active TB disease or if you have a high risk of exposure. Your risk of exposure is higher if you: Are a health care worker Work or live in a place where TB is more common, such as jails, nursing homes, and shelters for people without homes Were born in or often travel to countries where TB disease is common You may need a TB screening test if have symptoms of active TB disease, including: A cough that lasts longer than three weeks Coughing up blood or sputum (a thick mucus from the lungs) Chest pain Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Losing weight without trying Loss of appetite Weakness or fatigue You may need a TB screening test if you have a health condition that increase your risk for getting active TB disease. These conditions include: HIV or another disease that weakens your immune system Diabetes Having an organ transplant Use of illegal drugs that are injected with needles1What happens during a TB screening? You may get a TB screening test at your provider's office, a health clinic, or hospital. You will have either be a TB skin test or a TB blood test, depending on your health and medical history. TB skin tests are used more often, but blood tests for TB are becoming more common. For a TB skin test (also called a Mantoux tuberculin skin test), you will need two visits to complete the test. The first visit is for doing the test and the second visit is for reading the results. On the first visit: A health care professional will use a tiny needle to place a small amount of fluid under the skin in the lower part of your arm. The fluid is called tuberculin. It contains a protein that comes from the bacteria that cause TB. It cannot make you sick. The fluid will make a small bump on your arm. The test spot will be left uncovered.  You will need to avoid touching the test spot or putting lotions on it. It's okay to get it wet. If it itches, you can put an ice cube or cold cloth on it. After two to three days, you will return for the second visit. A health care professional will look at the test spot on your arm to see if your skin reacted. If there is a bump of hard skin, the professional will measure the bump. The meaning of the bump depends on how large it is, your risk of exposure to TB germs, and your risk for developing active TB disease. The professional will let you know whether or not the bump means that you're likely to have TB germs in your body. For a TB test in blood (also called an IGRA test), a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for TB skin test or a TB blood test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a TB skin test or blood test. For a TB skin test, you may feel a pinch when the fluid is placed under your skin. For a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your TB skin or blood test results will usually be positive or negative. A positive result means that you have been infected with TB bacteria. You will need more tests to find out if you have a latent TB infection or TB disease. These tests may include a chest x-ray or a sputum culture. If you had a positive result on a TB skin test, you may have a TB blood test to confirm the result. A negative result means that your skin or blood did not react to the test. You are unlikely to have a latent TB infection or TB disease. But you may still need more testing if you: Have symptoms of TB Were tested sooner than six to eight weeks after an exposure to TB Have HIV Had a TB skin test after being around someone with TB disease Sometimes a TB blood test result will be "borderline," which means the test could not show for sure whether you have a TB infection. If this happens, you will likely be tested again. Overall, TB screening tests tend to be accurate. But TB blood tests are more accurate than TB skin tests. Your provider will consider whether anything about your health history might affect the accuracy of your test results. If you have questions about your results, talk with your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a TB screening? Both active TB disease and latent TB infections should be treated. The treatment for both conditions is antibiotics. To make sure you get rid of all the TB germs in your body, you'll need to follow the directions for taking your medicine. Treatment may last a few months to a year. Stopping treatment too soon can cause the infection to come back and make it harder to treat.1References American Lung Association [Internet]. Chicago: American Lung Association; c2022.

For example, some tumor markers are proteins that certain cancer cells make in larger amounts than normal cells do. Changes in the genes and other parts of tumor cells can be tumor markers, too. Certain tumor markers may be found in samples of body fluids, such as blood or urine (pee). Other tumor markers are found in samples of cells that are removed from a tumor during a biopsy. Tumor marker tests are mainly used after you have a cancer diagnosis. The test results may help answer important questions about your cancer, such as: How fast is the cancer growing? What type of treatment is most likely to help? Is the treatment really working? Has cancer come back after treatment? Not all cancers have known tumor markers. And the tumor markers that are known don't provide perfect information. That's because: Some conditions that aren't cancer may also cause high levels of certain tumor markers. Tumor marker tests can't tell whether tumor markers come from cancer or from another condition. Some people don't make high levels of the tumor markers that are commonly found in their type of cancer. But even with these limits, tumor marker testing can often give a more complete picture of your cancer when they are used along with the results of other tests and exams.1What are they used for? Tumor marker tests are mainly used to learn more about a known cancer. But in certain cases, they may be used to screen for cancer or to help diagnose the disease. Tumor marker tests are most often used after you have a cancer diagnosis. When used with other tests, tumor markers may help: Find out whether cancer has spread to other parts of your body (cancer stage) Predict how fast your cancer may grow, the chance of recovery, and whether cancer is likely to return Select the right treatment for your type of cancer. Some treatments work only with cancers that have certain tumor markers. Tumor markers that help plan treatment are also called biomarkers. Monitor how well your treatment is working. If tumor marker levels go down, it usually means your treatment is helping. Find any cancer that remains after treatment or cancer that comes back after treatment. Some tumor marker tests that use body fluids (mainly blood or urine) have a limited role in screening for certain types of cancer. The tests are mostly used to screen people who: Have a high risk for the type of cancer that's linked to the tumor marker being measured Have symptoms that could be from that type of cancer. Tumor marker tests that are used to screen for cancer can't diagnose cancer. If you have a high level of tumor markers, it only means that you're more likely to have cancer. A biopsy is usually needed to diagnose or rule out cancer. Tumor marker tests that use cells from a tumor may help diagnose cancer. These "tumor cell markers" are usually removed during a biopsy. They may be used with other tests to confirm a cancer diagnosis and decide on the best treatment.1Why do I need a tumor marker test? You may need a tumor marker test if you: Are currently being treated for cancer Have finished cancer treatment Have a high risk of getting a certain type of cancer because it runs in your family, or you have other conditions that increase your risk The type of test you have will depend on your health and health history, cancer diagnosis, and the symptoms you may have. Below are some of the most common types of tumor markers and how they are used. Some tumor markers are linked with only one type of cancer. Others are linked with many different types of cancers: See if cancer treatment is working See if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment Screen for prostate cancer Help diagnose prostate cancer Monitor treatment Check to see if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment See if cancer treatment is working See if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment Help diagnose liver cancer Find out if cancer has spread (the stage of cancer) See if cancer treatment is working Predict chances for recovery See if cancer treatment is working Predict chances for recovery1What happens during a tumor marker test? Blood tests are the most common type of tumor marker tests. Urine tests or biopsies are also frequently used to check for tumor markers. A biopsy is a minor procedure that involves removing a small piece of tissue for testing. For a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a urine test: Your health care provider will tell you how to provide your sample. For a biopsy: A provider will remove a small piece of tissue. There are many ways to do a biopsy, depending on where the sample is located. A biopsy of your skin may be done by cutting or scraping the area. A biopsy of tissue from inside your body may use a special needle to remove a sample or a small incision (cut) to remove all or part of a suspicious area.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? For a blood or urine test: You usually don't need any special preparations. For a biopsy: You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the procedure. Talk with your provider if you have any questions about preparing for your test.1Are there any risks to the test? For a blood test: There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. For a urine test: There is no risk to a urine test. For a biopsy: You may have a little bruising or bleeding at biopsy site. You may also have a little discomfort for a day or two.1What do the results mean? Your provider will review your tumor marker test results along with other information about your condition. Together, you can discuss how your results affect your diagnosis, treatment, and schedule for future testing. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Cancer.Net [Internet]. Alexandra (VA): American Society of Clinical Oncology; 2005-2022.

An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to make pictures of organs, tissues, and other structures inside your body. It allows your health care provider to see into your body without surgery. Ultrasound is also called ultrasonography or sonography. Ultrasound images may be called sonograms. Ultrasound can be used to treat certain medical conditions. But it's mostly used to help: Monitor the health and development of an unborn baby during pregnancy. Pregnancy ultrasound can help check if your baby is growing normally. It can screen for certain conditions, such as birth defects that can be seen in images. It can also check for pregnancy problems. For example, an ultrasound can show if your placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby) is in the right position. Pregnancy ultrasound may also be called "prenatal ultrasound," "fetal ultrasound," or "obstetrical ultrasound."  Diagnose the cause of a wide variety of medical conditions. Ultrasound is best used to learn about conditions that involve soft tissues, such as organs, glands, and blood vessels. Diagnostic ultrasound may be used if you have signs or symptoms of a problem, and an ultrasound may help diagnose or rule out possible causes. Guide certain biopsy procedures. Some biopsies use a needle to remove a sample of fluid or tissue from the body for testing. An ultrasound can find the abnormal area and guide the needle to the right place to collect the sample. There are different types of ultrasounds. One type, called Doppler ultrasound, can show movement in your body. For example, it can show your heart beating and the speed and direction of blood flowing through your blood vessels. It can also show the beating heart and movement of an unborn baby. Another type of ultrasound can create 3-D (three-dimensional) images. Other names: sonogram, ultrasonography, pregnancy sonography, fetal ultrasound, obstetric ultrasound, diagnostic medical sonography, diagnostic medical ultrasound1What is it used for? A pregnancy ultrasound may be used to: Check the size, position, heart rate, and age of the unborn baby See if there is more than one baby Screen for:

Genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome
Birth defects in the heart, brain and spinal cord, or other parts of the body

 Genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome Birth defects in the heart, brain and spinal cord, or other parts of the body Check the amount of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding an unborn baby) and the location of the placenta Guide the collection of test samples taking during amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) Diagnostic ultrasound has many uses. For example, ultrasound can help: Find the cause of pain, swelling, and other symptoms Look for blockages, growths, and structural problems in organs, glands, and blood vessels Tell the difference between cysts (fluid-filled sacs) and solid tumors Ultrasound may help diagnose medical conditions that involve many parts of the body, such as the: Heart and heart valves Blood vessels Organs in the abdomen (belly), including the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, or spleen Organs in the pelvis, including the urinary tract, and male and female reproductive organs Thyroid and parathyroid glands Kidneys Breasts Brain, spine, and hips in infants1Why do I need an ultrasound? If you're pregnant, it's common to have a routine ultrasound between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy to check on the health of your baby. If your provider suspects a problem, you may need an ultrasound at other times during your pregnancy. You may need a diagnostic ultrasound if you have signs or symptoms of certain types of medical conditions and your provider needs to look inside your body to help find the cause. If you're having a needle biopsy to remove fluid or tissue for a test, you may have an ultrasound as part of the procedure.1What happens during an ultrasound? An ultrasound is often done by a sonographer, a health care professional who has special training to do ultrasound exams. Ultrasounds may be done in different ways depending on the part of your body that's being examined. Most ultrasound exams include these general steps: You will remove clothing from the area that will be examined and lie on a table. The sonographer will spread a special gel on your skin over the area that will be examined. The sonographer will hold a wand-like device, called a transducer, and move it across your skin. The device sends sound waves into your body. The gel prevents air from getting between the device and your skin, which would block the soundwaves from entering your body.  The sound waves are a very high pitch, so you can't hear or feel them. The soundwaves "bounce" off the structures inside your body. The ultrasound device picks up the echoes and turns them into images on a computer screen. You may be able to see the images on the screen during your exam. After the exam is over, the sonographer will wipe the gel off your skin. For certain ultrasound exams, the ultrasound device is placed inside a body opening to get a clearer image. Depending on the organs being checked, the device may be placed in the: Vagina. This is called a transvaginal ultrasound. It helps view the uterus and ovaries. Rectum. This is called a transrectal ultrasound. It's usually done to view the prostate gland. Esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth and stomach). This is called a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). It's done to get clear images of the heart.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Preparations for an ultrasound exam depend on what part of your body is being checked. Some ultrasound exams require no preparation at all. Your provider will tell you if you need to prepare for your ultrasound and what to do. For example, if you're having an ultrasound to view your urinary tract, you may need to drink water so that you have a full bladder. You will have to hold your urine (pee) until the test is over. For other ultrasounds, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test.1Are there any risks to the test? Ultrasound has not been linked to any health harms. It's generally considered safe when trained sonographers use it correctly. Ultrasound doesn't use ionizing radiation like x-rays use, which makes it safer than x-ray. That's why ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging method for viewing an unborn baby during pregnancy. But in certain cases, ultrasound can affect fluids and tissues in the body. That's why most medical experts recommend using ultrasound only when it's needed to provide important medical information.1What do the results mean? The results of your ultrasound depend on the type of ultrasound you had. Your provider can explain what your results mean for your health. If you had a pregnancy ultrasound, normal results mean that your baby appears to be developing normally. But an ultrasound can't guarantee you'll have a healthy baby. If your results weren't normal, you may need more tests, including another ultrasound exam.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw4693 Uric Acid Test : 1What is a uric acid test? This test measures the amount of uric acid in a sample of your blood or urine (pee). Uric acid is a normal waste product that your body makes when it breaks down chemicals called purines. Purines come from your cells when they die. Purines are also found in many foods and beverages. Most uric acid dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine. If uric acid builds up in your blood, it can form needle-shaped  crystals in and around your joints. This condition is called gout. Gout is a type of arthritis that causes painful swelling in your joints. High uric acid levels can also cause kidney stones, or kidney failure. But not everyone with high levels of uric acid will have these problems. Other names: serum urate, UA, uric acid: serum and urine1What is it used for? A uric acid blood test may be used to: Help diagnose gout, usually when done with a synovial fluid analysis. Monitor uric acid levels in people who are having cancer chemotherapy or certain other cancer treatments. When treatment kills cancer cells quickly, they release large amounts of purines into the blood. This can lead to serious problems from high uric acid levels. Testing helps catch an increase in uric acid so it can be treated early. A uric acid urine test may be used to: Help find out whether high levels of uric acid are causing kidney stones Monitor the risk of developing kidney stones in people who have gout1Why do I need a uric acid test? You may need a uric acid blood test if you: Have symptoms of gout. Symptoms usually happen in one joint at a time. The big toe is most commonly affected, but your other toes, ankle, or knee may have symptoms, which include:

Intense pain
Swelling
Redness
Feeling warm

 Intense pain Swelling Redness Feeling warm Had or are having certain types of cancer treatments. You may also need a uric acid urine test if you: Have symptoms of a kidney stone, including:

Sharp pain in your lower abdomen (belly), side, groin or back
Blood in your urine
Frequent urge to urinate (pee)
Not being able to urinate at all or only urinating a little bit
Pain when urinating
Cloudy or bad-smelling urine
Nausea and vomiting
Fever and chills

 Sharp pain in your lower abdomen (belly), side, groin or back Blood in your urine Frequent urge to urinate (pee) Not being able to urinate at all or only urinating a little bit Pain when urinating Cloudy or bad-smelling urine Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills Have gout and your health care provider wants to monitor your risk for developing kidney stones1What happens during a uric acid test? A uric acid test may be done as a blood test or a urine test. Your provider will decide which test you need. For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a uric acid urine test, you'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual.  Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Usually, you don't need any special preparations for a uric acid blood test. Many medicines, including aspirin, can affect your uric acid levels. Taking niacin (vitamin B-3) can also affect your results. So, be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. But don't stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider first.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a uric acid blood or urine test.1What do the results mean? High uric acid levels in a blood test may happen if: Your body makes too much uric acid Your kidneys can't remove uric acid from your blood You are eating too many foods that cause high levels of purines such as:

Red meat and organ meats, including liver and kidney
Certain kinds of seafood, including shellfish, anchovies, sardines, trout, and tuna
Alcohol (all types)
High fructose corn syrup in soda and sweets

 Red meat and organ meats, including liver and kidney Certain kinds of seafood, including shellfish, anchovies, sardines, trout, and tuna Alcohol (all types) High fructose corn syrup in soda and sweets Your provider may order more tests to help diagnose what's causing the problem. High levels of uric acid may be related to many conditions, including: Gout Kidney disease Leukemia, multiple myeloma, or cancer that has spread in your body (metastatic cancer) Side effects from certain cancer treatments Alcohol use disorder Preeclampsia, a condition that can cause dangerously high blood pressure in pregnant women Low levels of uric acid in blood are uncommon and usually don't cause health problems. Health conditions that are related to low uric acid levels are usually diagnosed using other tests. High uric levels in urine, may be related to: Gout Kidney stones or having a high risk for kidney stones Leukemia, multiple myeloma, or cancer that has spread in your body Obesity An inherited genetic condition, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, that makes it hard for your body to get rid of uric acid Low levels of uric acid in urine may be related to kidney disease, lead poisoning, or alcohol use disorder. If your results show a high level of uric acid in your blood or urine, it doesn't always mean you have a condition that needs treatment. Many people have high levels of uric acid without having health problems. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Medicines and/or changes in your diet may help you keep your uric acid levels in a healthy range. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.11References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/aa15402 Urobilinogen in Urine : 1What is a Urobilinogen in Urine Test? A urobilinogen in urine test measures the amount of urobilinogen in your urine (pee). Normal urine contains some urobilinogen. Too much urobilinogen in urine may be a sign of a liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, or certain types of anemia. Little or no urobilinogen may be a sign of other problems with your liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts. Urobilinogen comes from bilirubin. Your body makes bilirubin during the normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. Your liver uses the bilirubin to make bile, a fluid that helps you digest food in your intestines. Some bile flows through ducts (small tubes) from your liver directly into your intestines. The rest is stored in your gallbladder for when you need it. Good bacteria in your intestines breaks down the bilirubin in your bile and makes urobilinogen. Some of the urobilinogen leaves your body in your stool (poop). Some of it enters your bloodstream and returns to your liver, where it's "recycled" into bile. A small amount of urobilinogen leaves your body in urine. Little or no urobilinogen in urine may mean that something is blocking bile from flowing into your intestines. High levels of urobilinogen in urine may be a sign that: Your liver is making too much bilirubin because your body breaks down red blood cells faster than it can make them. This condition is called hemolytic anemia. Your liver can't recycle urobilinogen into bile because of liver disease. Other names: urine test; urine analysis; UA, chemical urinalysis1What is it used for?  A urobilinogen in urine test may part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and other substances in your urine. A urinalysis is often used to check your general health. It can also help diagnose diseases that affect the liver and many other medical conditions.1Why do I need a urobilinogen in urine test? Your health care provider may order this test as part of your regular checkup or to monitor an existing liver condition. You may also have this test if you have symptoms of a liver disease or hemolytic anemia. The symptoms of liver disease may include: Nausea and vomiting Lack of appetite Fatigue Weakness Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly) Swelling in your ankles and legs Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop) Frequent itching The symptoms of hemolytic anemia may include: Fatigue Dizziness Heart palpitations (feeling that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast) Headache Confusion Jaundice Larger than normal liver or spleen1What happens during a urobilinogen in urine test? You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the "clean catch" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Open the container without touching the inside. Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:

For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.
For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.

 For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first. For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back. Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body. Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed. Finish urinating into the toilet. Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed. If you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having this test.1What do the results mean? If your test results show too little or no urobilinogen in your urine, it may be a sign of: A blockage in the ducts that carry bile from your liver or gallbladder to your intestines A blockage in the blood flow through the liver A problem with liver function If your test results show a higher-than-normal level of urobilinogen, it may be a sign of: Hepatitis Cirrhosis Liver damage due to medicines Hemolytic anemia If your test results aren't  normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines and supplements can affect your results, so be sure to let your provider know what you are taking. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a urobilinogen in urine test? A urobilinogen in urine test alone cannot diagnose a specific condition. If your test results aren't normal, your provider may order other tests to help diagnose liver disease or hemolytic anemia.1References Hinkle J, Cheever K.

A V/Q scan consists of two imaging tests that look for certain lung problems. The tests are: A ventilation scan, which measures how air moves in and out of your lungs A perfusion scan, which measures circulation (how blood flows in the lungs) The two scans may be done separately or together. A V/Q scan uses a small amount of a radioactive substance called a tracer that helps look for disease in the body. The scans help diagnose different lung conditions, including a pulmonary embolism (PE). A PE is a life-threatening blockage in an artery in the lungs. It usually happens when a blood clot in another part of the body breaks loose and travels to the lungs. Other names: ventilation/perfusion scan, pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scan, lung scan, lung V/Q scan1What is it used for? A V/Q scan is most often used to check for a pulmonary embolism (PE). It may also be used to: Find problems with blood flow in the lungs Check lung function before lung surgery Test lung function in people with certain lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), a disease that causes coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.1Why do I need a V/Q scan? You may need a V/Q scan if you have symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE). These include: Trouble breathing Chest pain Coughing or coughing up blood Rapid heartbeat Many people with a PE don't have symptoms. But your provider may order a V/Q scan based on a physical exam and/or if you have certain risk factors. These include: Family history of blood clots or PE Long periods of inactivity that may be due to prolonged sitting (such as from long car trips or flights), bed rest or other reasons Recent surgery Obesity Older age Smoking You may also be at higher risk if you have: A clotting disorder Cancer Heart disease Another lung disease, such as COPD1What happens during a V/Q scan? V/Q scans are usually performed in a radiology clinic or a hospital. You may be getting a ventilation scan or a perfusion scan, or you may get both scans. If you are getting both, one scan will be done right after the other. For both types of scans: You will lie very still on a special table while the scanner takes pictures of your lungs. Before the scan, you will be given a substance called a radioactive tracer. The tracer sends out a form of energy called gamma rays. The rays are picked up by the scanner to create images of your lungs. During a ventilation scan: You will wear a face mask and breathe in a gas that contains the radioactive tracer A health care provider will use the scanner to take pictures of your lungs while you are holding your breath. Your provider will continue to take pictures while you breathe in the tracer gas for a few more minutes. After the tracer gas has collected in your lungs, your provider will remove your face mask. As you breathe normally, the tracer will leave your lungs. During a perfusion scan: A health care provider will inject the radioactive tracer into your vein through an intravenous (IV) line. The tracer will collect in the blood vessels of your lungs. Your provider will use the scanner to take pictures of your lungs. You will be moved into several positions during the test so the scanner can capture images of the lungs from different angles.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? A chest x-ray is usually done before a V/Q scan.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little exposure to radiation in a V/Q scan. Only a small amount of radioactive substance is used, and all of the radiation leaves the body within a few days. While radiation exposure in a V/Q scan is safe for most adults, it can be harmful to an unborn baby. So be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant Also, tell your provider if you are breastfeeding, because the tracer may contaminate your breast milk. You may have a little discomfort when the tracer is injected during a perfusion scan. Allergic reactions to the tracer are rare and usually mild.1What do the results mean? If your ventilation and/or perfusion scan results were not normal, it may mean you have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and will need medical treatment right away. The scans may also show that you have a different condition affecting your lungs. These include: COPD Pneumonia Heart failure If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a V/Q scan? If you are diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism (PE), your treatment may include medicines such as blood thinners, which help prevent clots from forming, or clot busters, which help dissolve clots quickly. If the medicines don't work, or you have a very large clot, you may need a surgical procedure to prevent and/or remove the clots.1References Bajc M, Jonson B.

Videonystagmography (VNG) is a test that measures a type of involuntary eye movement called nystagmus. These movements can be slow or fast, steady or jerky. Nystagmus causes your eyes to move from side to side or up and down, or both. It happens when the brain gets conflicting messages from your eyes and the balance system in the inner ear. These conflicting messages can cause dizziness. You can briefly get nystagmus when you move your head a certain way or look at some types of patterns. But if you get it when you don't move your head or if it lasts a long time, it may mean you have a disorder of the vestibular system. Your vestibular system includes organs, nerves, and structures that are in your inner ear. It is your body's main center of balance. The vestibular system works together with your eyes, sense of touch, and brain. Your brain communicates with the different systems in your body to control your balance. Other names: VNG1What is it used for? VNG is used to find out if you have a disorder of the vestibular system (the balance structures in your inner ear) or in the part of the brain that controls balance.1Why do I need a VNG? You may need a VNG if you have symptoms of a vestibular disorder. The main symptom is dizziness, a general term for different symptoms of imbalance. These include vertigo, a feeling that you or your surroundings are spinning, staggering while walking, and lightheadedness, a feeling like you are going to faint. Other symptoms of a vestibular disorder include: Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements that go side to side or up and down) Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear Confusion1What happens during a VNG? A VNG may be done by a primary health care provider or one of the following types of specialists: An audiologist, a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and managing hearing loss An otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor specializing in treating diseases and conditions of the ears, nose, and throat A neurologist, a doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain and nervous system During a VNG test, you will sit in a dark room and wear special goggles. The goggles have a camera that records eye movements. There are three main parts to a VNG: Ocular testing. During this part of the VNG, you will watch and follow moving and nonmoving dots on a light bar. Positional testing. During this part, your provider will move your head and body in different positions. Your provider will check if this movement causes nystagmus. Caloric testing. During this part, warm and cool water or air will be put in each ear. When cold water or air enters the inner ear, it should cause nystagmus. The eyes should then move away from the cold water in that ear and slowly back. When warm water or air is put in the ear, the eyes should move slowly toward that ear and slowly back. If the eyes don't respond in these ways, it may mean there is damage to the nerves of the inner ear. Your provider will also check to see if one ear responds differently from the other. If one ear is damaged, the response will be weaker than the other, or there may be no response at all.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a VNG? You may need to make changes in your diet or avoid certain medicines for a day or two before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to a VNG? The test may make you feel dizzy for a few minutes. You may want to make arrangements for someone to drive you home, in case the dizziness lasts for a longer period of time.1What do the results mean? If the results were not normal, it may mean you have a disorder of the inner ear. These include: Meniere's disease, a disorder that causes dizziness, bouts of hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). It usually affects only one ear. Although there is no cure for Meniere's disease, the disorder may be managed with medicine and/or changes in your diet. Labyrinthitis, a disorder that causes vertigo and imbalance. It is caused when part of the inner ear becomes infected or swollen. The disorder sometimes goes away on its own, but you may be prescribed antibiotics if you are diagnosed with an infection. An abnormal result may also mean you have a condition that affects the parts of the brain that helps control your balance. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about a VNG? Another test called electronystagmography (ENG) measures the same type of eye movements as a VNG. It also uses ocular, positional, and caloric testing. But instead of using a camera to record eye movements, an ENG measures eye movements with electrodes placed on the skin around the eyes. While ENG testing is still being used, VNG testing is now more common. Unlike an ENG, a VNG can measure and record eye movements in real time. VNGs can also provide clearer pictures of eye movements.1References American Academy of Audiology [Internet]. Reston (VA): American Academy of Audiology; c2019.

A vision screening is a brief test that mainly checks how well you can see things up close and far away. It's also called an eye test. The test usually involves reading letters on an eye chart. A vision screening is a quick way to find out if you need a comprehensive (complete) eye exam. A complete exam checks both your vision and eye health. It looks for signs of serious eye disorders that may not have symptoms, such as glaucoma. Children usually have vision screening tests as part of routine health checkups. Older children may also have vision screening tests at school. For infants and toddlers, health care providers use different screening tests to check the health of the child's eyes and whether the eye muscles are working correctly. Adults may have their vision screened during routine health checkups. But usually, their vision is screened as part of a complete eye exam from an eye care specialist. Eye care specialists who do complete exams include ophthalmologists and optometrists. Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who diagnose and treat all types of vision and eye disorders. Optometrists have advanced training to diagnose are treat certain types of vision and eye disorders. Vision screening may miss certain types of eye disorders, so it's important for children and adults to have regular eye exams. Your or your child's provider or eye care specialist can tell you how often to have eye exams. Other names: eye test, vision test1What is it used for? For infants and children: Your child's provider will use special vision screening tests to look for signs of common eye conditions that need early treatment to prevent long-term loss of vision. These eye conditions include: Amblyopia. Children with amblyopia have poor vision that usually happens in just one eye. It's caused by a problem with how the brain and eye work together. It's sometimes called "lazy eye." Amblyopia is the most common cause of vision loss in children. Strabismus. This condition causes each eye to look in a different direction. One or both eyes may turn in ("cross-eyes") or turn out ("walleyes"). If strabismus isn't corrected, it can cause amblyopia and permanent eye damage. For adults and children starting at about age 3, screening for problems with near and far vision is used to help find common vision problems that can be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses. In certain cases, eye surgery may also be an option. These conditions include: Nearsightedness (myopia), a condition that makes far away things look blurry. Farsightedness (hyperopia), a condition that makes close-up things look blurry. Astigmatism, which causes generally blurry vision and makes it hard to see at night. Presbyopia (only in middle-aged adults and older), this condition makes it hard to see things up close. It's a normal part of aging that makes the lens of the eye less flexible. Presbyopia often begins around age 45.1Why do I need vision screening? For adults, vision screening helps find out whether you need a complete eye exam from an eye care specialist. If you have vision screening as part of a complete eye exam, the test will show how well you're seeing at different distances, including with corrective lenses (eyeglasses or contact lenses). If you have problems with your eyes or vision, contact your provider or eye care specialist. Babies and children need regular vision screening. This helps find and correct vision problems before they affect learning or cause permanent vision loss. Ask your child's provider how often your child should have vision screening tests. In general: Newborns should be checked for eye infections and signs of other eye disorders. At 6 months to a year, eyes and vision should be checked during a regular well-baby visit. These tests are needed to check for early signs of strabismus. At 3 years, screening for near and far vision may begin for children who are able to describe what they see on an eye chart. This screening can be used with other tests to check for signs of amblyopia. All children should have at least one vision screening between age 3 and 5. If your child has symptoms of an eye disorder, a vision screening may help decide if an exam from an eye care specialist is needed. For babies under a year old, symptoms include: After 3 months: Not being able to follow a moving toy or other object with their eyes. After 4 months: Eyes that don't look properly lined up. Before 4 months, it's normal if your baby's eyes briefly look in different directions from each other. For older children, other symptoms of vision problems include: Squinting or frowning Closing or covering one eye Trouble reading and/or doing close-up work Complaining that things are blurry Blinking more than usual Crankiness when using close-up vision, such as looking at books One or both eyes that are watery, red, swollen, or crusted1What happens during vision screening? There are several types of vision screening tests. Vision screening for children and adults includes: Distance vision test. This test is also called a "visual acuity" test. It checks how well you can see things far away. Usually, you'll read rows of letters off a wall chart or a video monitor. Each row of letters is smaller than the one before it. To take the test, you usually stand 20 feet from the chart and cover one eye. You read the letters one row at a time until you get to a row with letters that are too small for you to see. Each eye is tested separately. Some eye charts use a capital E that points in different directions. Special charts for young children may use pictures or symbols. Close-up vision test. For this test, you hold a small card about 14 inches away from your face. The card has several lines of printed text that get smaller and smaller. You read the text out loud using both eyes at the same time. This test checks for farsightedness in children and adults, and for presbyopia in adults. Color blindness test. Color blindness means you see colors differently than most people. You may also have trouble telling certain colors apart. Children are usually tested once for color vision. They're shown a picture of colored numbers or symbols in a background of multicolored dots. If they can't see the numbers or symbols, they are color blind. Vision screening for infants includes checking: How well your baby's eyes can follow a moving object, such as a toy How your baby's pupils (the black center part of the eye) respond to a bright light Whether your baby blinks when a light shines in the baby's eye Whether both eyes focus together1Will I need to do anything to prepare for vision screening? If you or your child wears glasses or contact lenses, bring them with you to the screening. Your provider may want to check the prescription.1Are there any risks to screening? There is no risk to a vision screening.1What do the results mean? If vision screening shows a possible vision problem or eye disorder, you or your child will likely be referred to an eye care specialist for a more complete eye exam and treatment. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about vision screening? There are different types of eye care specialists. These are some of the most common types: Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who specialize in preventing, diagnosing, and treating eye disease. They provide complete eye exams, prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and perform eye surgery. Optometrists are health care professionals who specialize in vision problems and eye disorders. They provide many of the same services as ophthalmologists, including eye exams, prescribing eyeglasses and contact lenses, and treating some eye disorders. In some states, optometrists can perform certain eye surgeries. For complex eye disorders or surgeries, you will need to see an ophthalmologist. Opticians are health professionals who are trained to fill prescriptions for eyeglasses. They fit you for frames and prepare your eyeglasses. Many opticians also provide contact lenses. An optician can't give you a complete eye exam, but may screen your vision with an eye chart.1References American Academy of Ophthalmology [Internet].

B vitamins are nutrients that your body needs to work well and stay healthy. There are eight different types. A vitamin B test checks the level of one or more B vitamins in a sample of your blood or urine (pee). All the B vitamins together are called the "B vitamin complex." The B vitamins are: B1, thiamine B2, riboflavin B3, niacin (also called nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) B5, pantothenic acid B6, pyridoxal phosphate B7, biotin B9, folate (folic acid) B12, cobalamin Each type of vitamin B plays different important roles in your body, such as helping to: Maintain normal metabolism (the process your body uses to make energy from food you eat) Make healthy blood cells Keep your nervous system working properly You get B vitamins from many foods, including leafy green vegetables, meats and fish, eggs, whole grains, milk, and other dairy products. A lack of vitamin B is rare in the United States, because many foods have added B vitamins. These foods include cereals, breads, and pasta. But certain diets and health conditions can affect how well your body absorbs vitamin B. And if you lack B vitamins, it can cause serious health problems. For example, a lack of B12 can cause anemia and nerve disorders. A lack of B vitamins is called a vitamin B deficiency. It's usually treated with supplements. But it's important to talk with your health care provider before taking vitamin B supplements. That's because large amounts of some B vitamins can cause health problems, too. And some B vitamins may affect the way certain medicines work in your body. Other names: vitamin B testing, vitamin B complex, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxal phosphate (B6), biotin (B7), vitamin B12, folic acid, folate, and cobalamin test1What is it used for? Vitamin B testing is used if you have symptoms that suggest you may not be getting enough of one or more B vitamins. For example, a vitamin B12 and folate test is often used for symptoms of certain types of anemia. If you have a condition that increases your risk for a vitamin B deficiency, your provider may check your vitamin B levels even if you don't have symptoms.1Why do I need a vitamin B test? You may need a vitamin B test if you have symptoms that could mean you're lacking certain B vitamins. The symptoms depend on which type of a vitamin B deficiency you have. For example, common symptoms from a lack of vitamin B6 may include: Itchy rashes Cracks at the corners of the mouth Scaly skin on the lips Swollen tongue Common symptoms from a lack of vitamin B12 may include: Fatigue Arrhythmia (problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Weight loss when you're not trying to lose weight Tingly or numb hands and feet (a sign of nerve problems) You may also need vitamin B testing if you have a condition or habits that increase your risk of having a vitamin B deficiency, such as: Celiac or Crohn's disease Alcohol use disorder (AUD) Malabsorption syndrome Not eating foods that are rich in B vitamins, such as animal products (meat, eggs, and/or dairy foods) Having had surgery on your digestive system, including gastric bypass surgery for weight loss Taking certain medicines that affect how your body uses certain B vitamins1What happens during a vitamin B test? Vitamin B levels may be checked in blood or urine. For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a urine test, you may have a random urine test or a 24-hour urine sample test. For a random urine test, you will provide a single sample of urine at any time of the day. You'll usually collect your sample at your provider's office or a lab. For a 24-hour urine sample test, you'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your sample. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps: To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual.  Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated. For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container. During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or cooler with ice. 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test. Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Before a vitamin B blood test, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. A urine test doesn't require any special preparations.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no known risk to having a urine test.1What do the results mean? Your results will show the amount of each B vitamin that was tested. If your vitamin B levels are normal, but you have symptoms, you may need other tests to diagnose your condition. If you're lacking in one or more B vitamins, you may need other tests to find out why.  Your provider may recommend taking vitamin B supplements. In certain cases, vitamins may be given by intravenous (IV) treatment. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about vitamin B testing? The meaning of vitamin B test results isn't always clear. That's because several things can affect the results, including inflammation in your body and certain medicines. And medical experts aren't sure what a normal level is for certain B vitamins. Different labs have different ranges for normal levels, too. Your provider can explain what your test results say about your health.1References Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing [Internet].

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/en-us/hw43820 Vitamin D Test : 1What is a Vitamin D Test? A vitamin D test measures the level of vitamin D in your blood to make sure you have enough for your body to work well. Vitamin D is essential for healthy bones and teeth. It also helps keep your muscles, nerves, and immune system working normally. Having low levels of vitamin D is a common problem that can lead to bone disorders and other medical problems. Vitamin D testing can let you know if you need to increase your vitamin D levels. You get vitamin D in three ways: Your body makes vitamin D when your bare skin is exposed to sunlight. You get vitamin D from certain foods. Only a few foods, such as egg yolks and fatty fish, naturally contain vitamin D. That's why vitamin D is added to foods, including breakfast cereals, milk, and other dairy items. You can take vitamin D supplements. Before your body can use vitamin D, your liver must change it into another form called 25 hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D. Most vitamin D blood tests measure the level of 25(OH)D in your blood. Your kidneys use 25(OH)D to make "active vitamin D." Active vitamin D lets your body use calcium to build bone and helps other cells work properly. If you have kidney problems or abnormal calcium levels in your blood, your health care provider may order a test of active vitamin D. But this test is not generally used to check whether you have enough vitamin D. Testing 25(OH)D is the most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your blood. Other names: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D, cholecalciferol test, ergocalciferol test, calcidiol test, vitamin D2 test, vitamin D3 test1What is it used for? A vitamin D test is used to screen for low levels of vitamin D in your blood so you can treat it with supplements before it causes health problems. If you have a known bone disorder or a problem absorbing calcium, a vitamin D test may be used to see if a lack of vitamin D is causing your condition. Your provider may order a Vitamin D test if you have: Osteomalacia, soft bones, often with muscle weakness Low bone density, which can lead to osteoporosis. Rickets, a problem with bone growth in children Because vitamin D can affect many parts of your body, you may have your vitamin D level checked if you have other chronic (long-term) medical conditions. Ask your provider if you should be tested.1Why do I need a vitamin D test? Your provider may order a vitamin D test if you have signs or symptoms of a bone condition that may be related to a vitamin D deficiency (very low levels of vitamin D), such as: Bone pain Muscle weakness or aches Soft bones Deformed bones Weak bones and fractures (broken bones) Low bone density (osteoporosis or osteopenia) A vitamin D insufficiency (mildly low levels of vitamin D) usually doesn't cause symptoms. So, your provider may order a test if you have a high risk for developing a deficiency because you: Are older than 65. As you age, your skin is less able to make vitamin D from sunlight. Rarely expose your skin to sunshine because you stay indoors, cover up outside, use sunscreen, or live where there is little sunlight Have dark skin, which makes less vitamin D from sunlight Have had weight loss surgery Have obesity Have a condition that makes it difficult to absorb nutrients in food, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease Have kidney or liver disease that affects your ability to change vitamin D into a form your body can use Take certain medicines that affect your vitamin D levels A lack of vitamin D can cause serious problems for babies and children. A provider may order a screening test for: Babies that are mainly fed breastmilk. Breastmilk is low in vitamin D (All babies need vitamin D supplements shortly after birth, unless they are fed only formula, which contains vitamin D.) Children with darker skin who live in areas with little sunlight Children with diets low in vitamin D If you are taking vitamin D supplements to increase your vitamin D level, your provider may order a test to see if your vitamin D levels are improving.1What happens during a vitamin D test? A vitamin D test is a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a vitamin D test.1Are there any risks to the test?  There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Your test results may be reported in different ways. It may give you a total vitamin D result, or it may include separate results for vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. These two types of vitamin D work about the same in your body. Your total vitamin D level is the sum of these two types. The total vitamin D number is the important number. If your total vitamin D level shows a vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, it may mean you: Don't get enough vitamin D from your diet and/or exposure to sunlight Have trouble absorbing vitamin D in your food, which may be a sign of a malabsorption disorder Have trouble changing vitamin D into a form your body can use, which may be a sign of kidney or liver disease The treatment for low vitamin D levels is usually supplements and/or dietary changes. This is usually safer than getting more sun, which may cause skin cancer. If your total vitamin D level shows you have too much vitamin D, it is most likely from getting too much from supplements. This is very uncommon, but if it happens, you'll need to stop taking these supplements to reduce your vitamin D levels.  Too much vitamin D can cause serious damage to your organs and blood vessels. If you take vitamin D supplements, ask your provider what dose is right for you. To learn what your vitamin D test results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a vitamin D test? Be sure to tell your provider about medicines, vitamins, or supplements you are taking, because they can affect your test results.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid=vitamin_D Vitamin E (Tocopherol) Test : 1What is a vitamin E (tocopherol) test? A vitamin E test measures the amount of vitamin E in your blood. Vitamin E (also known as tocopherol or alpha-tocopherol) is a nutrient that is found in every cell of your body. It helps your nerves and muscles work well, prevents blood clots, and boosts your immune system so it can fight off infections from germs. Vitamin E is a type of antioxidant, which means that it protects cells from damage. But if you have too little or too much vitamin E in your body, it can cause serious health problems. Most people get the right amount of vitamin E from foods, including vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocadoes, and green, leafy vegetables. Vitamin E is also added to foods, such as certain cereals, fruit juices and margarine. The amount of vitamin E you get from foods doesn't cause high levels. High levels usually happen from taking too many vitamin E supplements. Low levels are often caused by digestive diseases, including malabsorption disorders that make it difficult for your body to digest fat. Your body needs fat to absorb vitamin E. Other names: tocopherol test, alpha-tocopherol test, vitamin E, serum1What is it used for? A vitamin E test may be used to: Find out if you are absorbing enough vitamin E, especially if you have a disorder that affects how your body uses vitamin E. Check vitamin E levels in premature babies. Babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy often lack vitamin E and may develop serious health problems if they aren't treated. Find out if you are getting too much vitamin E, especially if you have symptoms and have been taking vitamin E supplements.1Why do I need a vitamin E test? You may need a vitamin E test if you have symptoms of vitamin E deficiency (low levels of vitamin E) or vitamin E excess (high levels of vitamin E). Symptoms of a vitamin E deficiency often involve damage to the nerves and muscles. They include: Muscle weakness Loss of feeling in your arms and legs Problems walking and controlling your body movements Vision problems Vitamin E deficiency is very uncommon in healthy people. Most of the time, it's caused by conditions that prevent your body from properly absorbing vitamin E, including: Crohn's disease Liver disease Cystic fibrosis Celiac disease Pancreatitis Certain genetic disorders, including ataxia with vitamin E deficiency and abetalipoproteinemia (very uncommon) Eating an extremely low-fat diet can also lead to a vitamin E deficiency. Symptoms of too much vitamin E include: Diarrhea Nausea Fatigue Vitamin E excess is also uncommon. It usually happens from taking too many vitamin E supplements. Without treatment, too much vitamin E can increase your risk of bleeding, including bleeding in the brain, called a hemorrhagic stroke.1What happens during a vitamin E test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for 12–14 hours before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? Normal vitamin E levels vary with age. Your test results should say if your results are normal for your age. Low vitamin E levels mean you are not getting or absorbing enough vitamin E. Your provider will use your medical history and the results from other tests to diagnose the cause. You can usually treat Vitamin E deficiency by taking vitamin supplements and treating any conditions that may be blocking absorption. High vitamin E levels mean you are getting too much vitamin E. If you have been taking vitamin E supplements, you will need to stop. If vitamin E has caused problems with bleeding, your provider may also prescribe medicines to treat you. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a vitamin E test? Some people believe vitamin E supplements can help prevent certain disorders. But there is no solid evidence that vitamin E has any effect on heart disease, cancer, eye disease, or mental function. Taking Vitamin E supplements may affect how certain medicines work, including certain blood thinners and cancer medicines. It may also affect your body's ability to use other vitamins. So, before taking any dietary supplements, always talk with your provider to find out if they are safe for you.1References Blount BC, Karwowski, MP, Shields PG, Morel-Espinosa M, Valentin-Blasini L, Gardner M, Braselton M, Brosius CR, Caron KT, Chambers D, Corstvet J, Cowan E, De Jesús VR, Espinosa P, Fernandez C, Holder C, Kuklenyik Z, Kusovschi JD, Newman C, Reis GB, Rees J, Reese C, Silva L, Seyler T, Song MA, Sosnoff C, Spitzer CR, Tevis D, Wang L, Watson C, Wewers, MD, Xia B, Heitkemper DT, Ghinai I, Layden J, Briss P, King BA, Delaney LJ, Jones CM, Baldwin, GT, Patel A, Meaney-Delman D, Rose D, Krishnasamy V, Barr JR, Thomas J, Pirkl, JL.

Blood tests are used to measure or examine cells, chemicals, proteins, or other substances in the blood. Blood testing, also known as blood work, is one of the most common types of lab tests. Blood work is often included as part of a regular checkup. Blood tests are also used to: Help diagnose certain diseases and conditions Monitor a chronic disease or condition, such as diabetes or high cholesterol Find out if treatment for a disease is working Check how well your organs are working. Your organs include your liver, kidneys, heart, and thyroid. Help diagnose bleeding or clotting disorders Find out if your immune system is having trouble fighting infections1What are the different types of blood tests? There are many different types of blood tests. Common ones include: Complete blood count (CBC). This test measures different parts of your blood, including red and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin. A CBC is often included as part of a regular checkup. Basic metabolic panel. This is a group of tests that measure certain chemicals in your blood, including glucose, calcium, and electrolytes. Blood enzyme tests. Enzymes are substances that control chemical reactions in your body. There are many types of blood enzyme tests. Some of the most common types are troponin and creatine kinase tests. These tests are used to find out if you've had a heart attack and/or if your heart muscle is damaged. Blood tests to check for heart disease. These include cholesterol tests and a triglyceride test. Blood clotting tests, also known as a coagulation panel. These tests can show if you have a disorder that causes too much bleeding or too much clotting.111What happens during a blood test? A health care provider will need to take a sample of your blood. This is also called a blood draw. When a blood draw is taken from a vein, it's known as venipuncture.  During venipuncture, a lab professional, known as a phlebotomist, will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Venipuncture is the most common way to do a blood test.  Other ways to do a blood test are: A finger prick test. This test is done by pricking your fingertip to obtain a small amount of blood. Finger prick testing is often used for at-home test kits and rapid tests. Rapid tests are easy to use tests that provide very fast results and require little or no special equipment. A heel stick test. This is most often done on newborns. During a heel stick test, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site. Arterial blood test. This test is done to measure oxygen levels. Blood from arteries has higher levels of oxygen than blood from a vein. So for this test, blood is taken from an artery instead of a vein. You may feel a sharp pain when the provider inserts the needle into the artery to get the blood sample.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for most blood tests. For some tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a finger prick test or venipuncture. During venipuncture, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is very little risk to your baby with a heel stick test. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. Collecting blood from an artery is more painful than collecting from a vein, but complications are rare. You may have some bleeding, bruising, or soreness at the spot where the needle was put in. Also, you should avoid lifting heavy objects for 24 hours after the test.11Is there anything else I should know about blood testing? Blood testing can provide important information about your health. But it doesn't always give enough information about your condition. If you've had blood work, you may need other types of tests before your provider can make a diagnosis.1References Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [Internet].

This test looks for white blood cells in a sample of your stool (poop). White blood cells are also called leukocytes, so this test is sometimes called a leukocytes in stool test. White blood cells are part of your immune system. They help your body fight off infections and other diseases. White blood cells in your stool are usually a sign that you have an infection or other condition in your digestive system that's causing inflammation. A white blood cell in stool test is used if you have diarrhea that could be caused by inflammation. Diarrhea from inflammation is severe and lasts for more than a couple days. It can include blood in stool, abdominal (belly) pain, and fever. It may be caused by: Certain bacterial infections, such as:


Clostridium difficile (C. diff). This infection mostly happens after taking antibiotics that kill the "good germs" that keep C. diff bacteria from growing in your body.
Some types of bacteria that cause "food poisoning," including:


Salmonella. Most infections come from contaminated food, but you can get salmonella from infected animals, especially reptiles and birds.
Shigella. Infection with shigella is called shigellosis. You can get it from food and touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your mouth.
Campylobacter. Infection can happen from food and contact with dog and cat feces (poop).

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes:


Ulcerative colitis
Crohn's disease

 Ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease A parasite (Entamoeba histolytica) which causes a disease called "amebiasis." Amebiasis is most common in tropical places with poor sanitary conditions. A white blood cell in stool test can't diagnose the exact condition that's causing diarrhea. But it can help narrow down the possible causes to conditions that either do or don't involve inflammation. Other names: leukocytes in stool, stool WBC, fecal WBC, fecal leukocyte test, FLT, FGST, fecal leukoctye gram stain screen1What is it used for? A white blood cell in stool test is used to find out whether diarrhea is caused by conditions that involve inflammation in the digestive system. It's mainly used for people who have diarrhea symptoms that suggest inflammation. These symptoms include: Watery diarrhea three or more times a day that doesn't get better after several days Abdominal (belly) cramps and/or pain Blood and/or mucus in stool Fever Fatigue Weight loss A white blood cell in stool test can't diagnose the condition that's causing diarrhea, so it's often used with other tests.1Why do I need a white blood cell in stool test? Most diarrhea goes away on its own after a day or two, and your health care provider doesn't need to find the cause. But you may need a white blood cell in stool test and other tests if you have symptoms of diarrhea from inflammation that don't improve after a few days. Knowing the cause of your diarrhea helps your provider choose the right treatment. That's important because ongoing diarrhea can lead to serious health problems, including dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. See your provider right away if you have: Signs of dehydration, including dry mouth, dark urine (pee), fatigue, or dizziness Diarrhea for more than 2 days, or for more than 24 hours in a young child or infant A fever of 102 degrees or higher Severe pain in the abdomen (belly) or rectum Stool that is black and tarry or contains blood or pus In adults: frequent vomiting or diarrhea 6 or more times in 24 hours1What happens during a white blood cell in stool test? You will need to provide a stool sample for your test. Your provider will probably give you a container or kit with instructions on how to collect the sample. There are different ways to collect stool samples, so follow the instructions carefully. In general, you'll need to: Label the container with your name, the collection date, and time. Collect a stool sample as instructed. This usually involves using a clean, dry container, or special paper or plastic wrap placed over the toilet to catch the stool. Make sure the stool doesn't mix with any urine, toilet paper, or water from the toilet. Close the container tightly. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Return the container according to the instructions. If you're collecting a sample from diapers, you'll get special instructions for using plastic wrap inside of a clean diaper. In certain cases, a provider may use a swab to take a stool sample from the rectum.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Certain medicines and foods may affect the test results. Ask your provider if there are any specific things you need to avoid before the test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a white blood cell in stool test.1What do the results mean? A positive or abnormal test result means that white blood cells were found in your stool sample. That means you have inflammation in your digestive tract. This information helps rule out conditions that don't cause inflammation, including viral infections, certain bacteria, and most parasites. Other tests can help find out what is causing your illness. A negative or normal test result means that no white blood cells were found in your stool sample. That may mean that inflammation isn't causing your illness. But a normal test result can't rule out conditions that cause inflammation. That's because white blood cells don't last long in a stool sample. If your stool sample contained a small number of cells that broke apart during testing, they may not show up. So, you could have inflammation in your digestive system even though your test didn't find any white blood cells in your stool. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a white blood cell in stool test? Instead of a white blood cell in stool test, your provider may order a more accurate test to check for inflammation in your digestive system. It's called a calprotectin fecal test. Calprotectin is a protein that certain white blood cells release in the intestine when there is inflammation.1References Akhondi H, Simonsen KA. Bacterial Diarrhea.

Available from: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid=stool_wbc White Blood Count (WBC) : 1What is a white blood count (WBC)? A white blood count measures the number of white cells in your blood. White blood cells are part of the immune system. They help your body fight off infections and other diseases. When you get sick, your body makes more white blood cells to fight the bacteria, viruses, or other foreign substances causing your illness. This increases your white blood count.  Other diseases can cause your body to make fewer white blood cells than you need. This lowers your white blood count. Diseases that can lower your white blood count include some types of cancer and HIV/AIDS, a viral disease that attacks white blood cells. Certain medicines, including chemotherapy, may also lower the number of your white blood cells. There are five major types of white blood cells: Neutrophils Lymphocytes Monocytes Eosinophils Basophils A white blood count measures the total number of these cells in your blood. Another test, called a blood differential, measures the amount of each type of white blood cell. Other names: WBC count, white cell count, white blood cell count1What is it used for? A white blood count is most often used to help diagnose disorders related to having a high white blood cell count or low white blood cell count. Disorders related to having a high white blood count include: Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissues Bacterial or viral infections Cancers such as leukemia and Hodgkin disease Allergic reactions Disorders related to having a low white blood count include: Diseases of the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS Lymphoma, a cancer of the bone marrow Diseases of the liver or spleen A white blood count can show if the number of your white blood cells is too high or too low, but it can't confirm a diagnosis. So it is usually done along with other tests, such as a complete blood count, blood differential, blood smear, and/or bone marrow test.1Why do I need a white blood count? You may need this test if you have signs of an infection, inflammation, or autoimmune disease. Symptoms of infection include: Fever Chills Body aches Headache Symptoms of inflammation and autoimmune diseases will be different, depending on the area of inflammation and type of disease. You may also need this test if you have a disease that weakens your immune system or are taking medicine that lowers your immune response. If the test shows your white blood count is getting too low, your provider may be able to adjust your treatment. Your newborn or older child may also be tested as part of a routine screening, or if they have symptoms of a white blood cell disorder.1What happens during a white blood count? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. To test children, a health care provider will take a sample from the heel (newborns and young babies) or the fingertip (older babies and children). The provider will clean the heel or fingertip with alcohol and poke the site with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a white blood count.1Are there any risks to the test? After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is very little risk to your baby or child with a needle stick test. Your child may feel a little pinch when the site is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.1What do the results mean? A high white blood count may mean you have one of the following conditions: A bacterial or viral infection An inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis An allergy Leukemia or Hodgkin disease Tissue damage from a burn injury or surgery A low white blood count may mean you have one of the following conditions: Bone marrow damage. This may be caused by infection, disease, or treatments such as chemotherapy. Cancers that affect the bone marrow An autoimmune disorder, such as lupus (or SLE) HIV/AIDS If you are already being treated for a white blood cell disorder, your results may show if your treatment is working or whether your condition has improved. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a white blood count? White blood count results are often compared with results of other blood tests, including a blood differential. A blood differential test shows the amount of each type of white blood cell, such as neutrophils or lymphocytes. Neutrophils mostly target bacterial infections. Lymphocytes mostly target viral infections. A higher than normal amount of neutrophils is known as neutrophilia. A lower than normal amount is known as neutropenia. A higher than normal amount of lymphocytes is known as lymphocytosis. A lower normal amount is known as lymphopenia. 1References Cleveland Clinic [Internet]. Cleveland (OH): Cleveland Clinic; c2020.

A whooping cough test usually uses fluid from your nose to help diagnose whooping cough, also known as pertussis. Whooping cough is a serious bacterial infection in your respiratory system. It may cause severe fits of rapid coughing. In serious cases, the coughing may last until all the air is gone from your lungs. This forces you to gasp for air, which makes a loud "whooping" sound.  After a coughing fit, your breathing becomes normal until you start coughing again. Whooping cough is easily spreads from person to person, usually by coughing or sneezing. You can get it at any age. But the illness is most serious in babies and children who are too young to have had all their childhood vaccines against whooping cough. Babies less than a year old who get whooping cough often need hospital care. Whooping cough tests can help diagnose the disease early. This is important because treatment is most helpful when it's started before serious coughing fits begin. The best way to protect against whooping cough is with pertussis vaccination. Vaccinated people may still get whooping cough, but their illness is usually milder and shorter. Other names: pertussis test, bordetella pertussis culture, PCR, antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgM)1What are the tests used for? Whooping cough tests are used to find out whether you or your child has whooping cough. Getting diagnosed and treated in the early stages of infection may make your symptoms less severe and help prevent the spread of the disease.1Why do I need a whooping cough test? Your health care provider may order a whooping cough test if you or your child has symptoms of whooping cough. You or your child may also need a test if you've been exposed to someone who has whooping cough and you have symptoms of a cold. Symptoms of whooping cough usually happen in three stages. It's best to get tested in the first stage, when treatment works best. In this stage, symptoms are like those of a common cold. They can last for one to two weeks and usually include: Runny nose Mild fever Mild cough (babies may not cough) Pauses in breathing in babies, called apnea In the second stage, the symptoms are more serious and may include: Severe coughing fits followed by a high-pitched "whoop" sound Coughing so hard it causes vomiting Feeling very tired after coughing fits Coughing fits may get worse and continue for 10 weeks or more. With milder illness, you may not "whoop." The infection is usually milder in teens and adults, especially those who have had the vaccine. In the third stage, the cough will be milder, and you'll cough less often. But recovery can be slow.1What happens during a whooping cough test? Two types of tests are commonly used to diagnose whooping cough. Both tests use a sample of fluid and cells from the back of your nose. Your provider may order one or both of these tests: Bacteria culture test. This test is most accurate when it's done during the first two weeks after coughing begins. Your fluid sample is sent to a lab. Cells in the sample are grown until there are enough to test. The sample is then checked for whooping cough bacteria. Test results may take up to a week. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. This test is most accurate when it's done in the first three to four weeks after coughing begins. A PCR test checks your fluid sample for genetic material from the whooping cough bacteria. Results may be ready in as soon as two hours. For a bacterial culture or a PCR test, your provider will use one of these ways to gather a sample of fluid and cells from your nose: Nasal aspirate or wash. Your provider will insert a saline solution into your nose, then remove the sample with gentle suction. Swab test. Your provider will use a special swab to take a sample from deep in your nose. Blood tests that look for antibodies to whooping cough are generally not used to diagnose infections. Researchers use these tests to study the spread of whooping cough in the community. Whooping cough antibodies are proteins in your blood that your immune system makes to fight the infection. A blood antibody test may be done from 2 to 12 weeks after coughing begins. So, the test may be used in later stages when culture and PCR tests may not give accurate results. If you have a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for a whooping cough test? You don't need any special preparations for a whooping cough test.1Are there any risks to the tests?  There is very little risk to whooping cough tests. A nasal aspirate or wash may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary. For a swab test, you may feel a gagging sensation or even a tickle when your nose is swabbed. For a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.1What do the results mean? For a bacteria culture test: A positive result means that you have whooping cough. A negative result may mean that you don't have whooping cough, but it doesn't rule it out. If your test sample was taken too late or if you took antibiotics before your test, the results may not be accurate. For a PCR test: A positive result means that genetic material from the whooping cough bacteria was found in your test sample, and you probably have whooping cough. But the PCR test may have found material from other related bacteria and mistaken it for whooping cough bacteria. A negative result means that you probably don't have whooping cough, but it doesn't rule it out. It's possible that your sample didn't have enough bacteria for the test to be accurate. To make a diagnosis, your provider will use your test results, your symptoms, and whether or not it was likely that you were exposed to whooping cough. Blood testing for whooping cough antibodies is not recommended for diagnosing a whooping cough infection. If you had this test and you were vaccinated, certain antibodies will show up in your test results. If a blood test finds certain other antibodies, it may mean you had a recent whooping cough infection. Whooping cough is treated with antibiotic medicine. Antibiotics can make your infection less serious if you start treatment before your cough gets bad. Treatment may also help prevent you from spreading the disease to others. If you have questions about your test results or treatment, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about whooping cough tests? Vaccination is the best protection against whooping cough, but it doesn't give lifetime protection. Ask your provider when you and your child need to be vaccinated. Your provider can also answer any questions you have about possible vaccine side effects. If you're pregnant, you should be vaccinated between the 27th and 36th week of your pregnancy. If you're vaccinated during each pregnancy, you will pass protection against whooping cough to your baby for the first months of life before the baby can be vaccinated.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

Xylose, also known as D-xylose, is a type of sugar that is normally easily absorbed by the intestines. A xylose test checks the level of xylose in both blood and urine. Levels that are lower than normal can mean there is a problem with your body's ability to absorb nutrients. Other names: xylose tolerance test, xylose absorption test, D-xylose tolerance test, D-xylose absorption test1What is it used for? A xylose test is most often used to: Help diagnose malabsorption disorders, conditions that affect your ability to digest and absorb nutrients from food Find out why a child is not gaining weight, especially if the child seems to be eating enough food1Why do I need a xylose test? You may need this test if you have symptoms of a malabsorption disorder, which include: Persistent diarrhea Abdominal pain Bloating Gas Unexplained weight loss, or in children, the inability to gain weight1What happens during a xylose test? A xylose test involves getting samples from both blood and urine. You will be tested before and after you drink a solution that contains 8 ounces of water that is mixed with a small amount of xylose. For the blood tests: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. Next, you will drink the xylose solution. You will be asked to rest quietly. Your provider will give you another blood test two hours later. For children, it may be one hour later. For the urine tests, you will need to collect all the urine you produce for five hours after you have taken the xylose solution. Your health care provider will give you instructions on how to collect your urine during the five-hour period.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You will need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test. Children younger than 9 years old should fast for four hours before the test. For 24 hours before the test, you will need to not eat foods high in a type of sugar known as pentose, which is similar to xylose. These foods include jams, pastries, and fruits. Your provider will let you know if you need to take any other preparations.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.  The xylose solution may make you feel nauseous. There is no risk to having a urine test.1What do the results mean? If your results showed lower than normal amounts of xylose in the blood or urine, it may mean you have a malabsorption disorder, such as: Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes a serious allergic reaction to gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Crohn's disease, a condition that causes swelling, inflammation, and sores in the digestive tract Whipple disease, a rare condition that prevents the small intestine from absorbing nutrients Low results may also be caused by an infection from a parasite, such as: Hookworm Giardiasis If your xylose blood levels were normal, but urine levels were low, it may be a sign of kidney disease and/or malabsorption. You may need more tests before your provider can make a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider.1Is there anything else I need to know about xylose testing? A xylose test takes a long time. You may want to bring a book, game, or other activity to keep yourself or your child occupied while you wait.

Available from: https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthwise/article/hw6154 Yeast Infection Tests : 1What is a Yeast Test? A yeast test can help find out whether you have a yeast infection. Yeast is a type of fungus that lives on your skin and genitals and in your mouth and intestines (gut). Candidiasis, candidosis, and moniliasis are other names for a yeast infection. Normally, yeast doesn't cause problems. But if yeast grows out of control, it can cause a bothersome infection that needs treatment. If you're generally healthy, a yeast infection is rarely serious. But in people with weakened immune systems, a yeast infection may become very serious. It may affect the blood, heart, brain, eyes, bones, and other parts of the body. This is called an invasive yeast infection. Other names: potassium hydroxide preparation, fungal culture; fungal antigen and antibody tests, calcofluor white stain, fungal smear1What is it used for? A yeast test is used to diagnose yeast infections. There are different methods of yeast testing, depending on where you have symptoms.1Why do I need a yeast test? Your health care provider may order a test if you have symptoms of a yeast infection. Symptoms depend on where the yeast is growing. Yeast infections tend to grow in moist areas of your skin and mucous membranes. These are the typical symptoms of some common types of yeast infections, but your symptoms may vary: Yeast infections on the folds of the skin include conditions such as athlete's foot and diaper rash. Symptoms include: Bright red rash, often with ulcers (open sores) Itching and/or burning Pimples Vaginal yeast infections are very common. Symptoms include: Genital itching and/or burning A white discharge that looks like cottage cheese Pain when urinating (peeing) and during sex Redness and swelling of the vagina and labia (folds of skin around the vagina) Yeast infection of the penis is more common if you have diabetes or a foreskin. Symptoms include: Redness Itching and/or burning Rash on the head of the penis that may be painful Yeast infection of the mouth is called thrush. It is common in young children. Thrush in adults may be a sign of a weakened immune system. Symptoms include: White patches on the:

Tongue
Inside of cheeks
Roof of the mouth
Throat

 Tongue Inside of cheeks Roof of the mouth Throat Redness or soreness Cotton-like feeling in the mouth Loss of taste Pain while eating Yeast infection at the corners of the mouth may be caused by thumb sucking, ill-fitting dentures, or frequent licking of the lips. Symptoms include: Cracks and redness at the corners of the mouth Yeast infection in the nail beds can happen in the fingernails or toenails, but it's more common in toenails. Symptoms include: Discolored nail (yellow, brown, or white) Thick nail Cracks in the nail Pain and redness if the infection is severe1What happens during a yeast test? The type of test depends on the location of your symptoms. To test for: A vaginal yeast infection - Your provider will perform a pelvic exam and take a sample of the discharge from your vagina. Thrush - Your provider will look at the infected area in the mouth and may scrape some cells to examine under the microscope. A yeast infection on the skin or nails - Your provider may use a blunt-edged instrument to scrape off a small bit of skin or part of a nail to examine. During this type of test, you may feel some pressure and a little discomfort. Your provider may be able to tell if you have a yeast infection just by looking at the infected area and examining a sample of the cells under a microscope. If there are not enough cells in the sample to find an infection, you may need a fungal culture test. During a fungal culture test, the cells in your sample are sent to a lab to grow until there are enough cells to test. Results are often available within a few days. But some yeast grows slowly, so it may take weeks to get a result. If your provider thinks you may have an invasive yeast infection in your blood or organs, you may have a fungal culture test or other tests on a sample of blood, other fluid, or tissue from the part of your body that may be infected.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparations for a yeast test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is no known risk to having a yeast test.1What do the results mean? If your results show that you have a yeast infection, your provider may recommend a prescription or over-the counter antifungal medicine. Antifungal medicines come in many forms for different types of infections, including pills, vaginal creams and suppositories, skin creams, powders, and lotions. Your provider will tell you which treatment is best for you. It's important to take all your medicine as prescribed, even if you feel better before you finish it. Many yeast infections get better after a few days or weeks of treatment, but certain fungal infections may need treatment for several months or longer before they clear up completely. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a yeast test? Certain antibiotics can cause yeast to grow out of control. So, be sure to tell your provider about any medicines you are taking. At-home tests for vaginal yeast infections can tell you if your symptoms are likely to be from a yeast infection. But they may not be able to confirm the diagnosis. It's best to talk with your provider about your symptoms and which test is best for you. This is important, because many symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection are the same as the symptoms from certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).1References Arya NR, Rafiq NB. Candidiasis.

Available from: https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/vaginal-yeast-infections Zika Virus Test : 1What is a Zika virus test? A Zika virus test looks for signs of a Zika virus infection in a sample of your blood or urine (pee). The virus is mostly spread by mosquito bites. But you can get Zika if you have sex with a person who has Zika, even if they don't have symptoms. Using condoms may help prevent spreading Zika through sex. A Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects in the unborn baby. Most unborn babies who get Zika will not have birth defects. But when birth defects happen, they often affect the brain and eyes. The main birth defect linked to Zika is microcephaly. Babies with microcephaly have smaller heads than normal because their brains don't develop properly. A Zika infection in pregnancy also increases the risk of other birth defects, miscarriage, premature labor, and stillbirth. Most people who get Zika have no symptoms or only mild symptoms that last a few days to a week. In rare cases, Zika may lead to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a serious illness that weakens your muscles. With proper care, most people will recover from GBS over time. Zika outbreaks come and go in different parts of the world. They tend to happen more often in tropical climates, including Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, parts of the Caribbean, and Central and South America. There have been outbreaks of Zika virus in the United States, but they have not been common. Other names: Zika Antibody Test, Zika RT-PCR Test, Zika test1What is it used for? If general, Zika virus testing is mostly used to diagnose a Zika infection if you: Have symptoms of Zika And have been in a part of the world where there is an active Zika outbreak. Sometimes your health care provider may recommend a test if you been to an area that has a risk for Zika outbreaks. There are two types of tests are used to check for Zika infections: Molecular tests. These tests look for genetic material from the Zika virus. The tests are also called nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT or NAT). A PCR test (polymerase chain reaction) is a common type of molecular test that checks for the Zika virus in a sample of your blood or urine. This test is recommended if you're pregnant. Antibody tests. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight viruses and other germs. A Zika antibody test checks a sample of your blood for the antibodies that fight Zika. Your body needs time to make antibodies. So, to be accurate, an antibody test can be done starting within a week after symptoms begin.1Why do I need a Zika virus test? Zika virus outbreaks tend to come and go. The recommendations for Zika testing are likely to change as outbreaks develop and disappear. If you have symptoms of Zika and you have been in a part of the world where there is an active Zika outbreak, you need a Zika virus test. If you are pregnant and: You have symptoms of Zika, you need a Zika virus test if:

You have recently traveled to an area outside of the U.S. where there is a risk of Zika (a country that has a current outbreak or has had Zika outbreaks in the past).
You have had sex with a partner who traveled to an area outside the U.S. where there is a risk of Zika.

 You have recently traveled to an area outside of the U.S. where there is a risk of Zika (a country that has a current outbreak or has had Zika outbreaks in the past). You have had sex with a partner who traveled to an area outside the U.S. where there is a risk of Zika. You have traveled to an area outside of the US where there is a risk of Zika, you may need a Zika virus test if:

Your provider sees problems on your baby's ultrasound that could be Zika.
You deliver a baby with birth defects that may have been caused by Zika.

 Your provider sees problems on your baby's ultrasound that could be Zika. You deliver a baby with birth defects that may have been caused by Zika. Most people with Zika don't have symptoms, but when there are symptoms, they often include: Fever Rash Joint pain Muscle pain Headache Pink eye (conjunctivitis) If you have symptoms of Zika and could have been exposed through sex with an infected person, contact your provider. Tell your provider about your possible exposure. Using condoms can reduce your chance of getting Zika from sex.1What happens during a Zika virus test? A Zika virus test usually uses a sample of your blood or urine. For a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. For a urine test: Ask your health care provider for instructions on how to provide your sample.1Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't any special preparations for a Zika virus test.1Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to a urine test.1What do the results mean? If you have a negative Zika virus result: On a molecular test, such as a PCR test, it means that you probably don't have a Zika infection. But you may need an antibody test to make sure you don't have Zika. On an antibody test, it means that you probably haven't had a recent Zika virus infection. But you may have been tested before your body had time to make enough antibodies to show up on the test. Your provider may suggest that you get tested again. If you have a positive Zika virus test result: On a molecular test, such as a PCR test, it means that you most likely have a Zika infection. The test found genetic material from the Zika virus in your sample. On an antibody test, it means that you may have a Zika infection, but you may need another test to confirm the results. That's because some Zika antibody tests may not tell the difference between Zika antibodies and antibodies that fight similar viruses that mosquitos carry. If you're pregnant and have a Zika infection, your provider will closely watch your pregnancy to see if Zika is affecting your baby. After birth, your baby will be tested for a Zika infection. If you have a Zika infection and you're planning to get pregnant in the near future, talk with your provider about how long you should wait. At this time, there's no evidence that getting pregnant after recovering from Zika has risks for the baby. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.1Is there anything else I need to know about a Zika virus test? If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you should avoid traveling in areas where Zika infection is a risk. If that's not possible, be careful to protect yourself against mosquito bites.1References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].
